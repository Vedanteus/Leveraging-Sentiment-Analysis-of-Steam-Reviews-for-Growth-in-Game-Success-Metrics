A solid and fun RPG today, but I think as time progresses, I think it will be eventually remembered as a beautiful and poignant story and piece of art, like how we view a classic work of literature today, like a Joseph Conrad novel or For Whom The Bell Tolls by Ernest Hemingway (both authors works are referenced which the writers make clear nods to). I'm so happy I played it and avoided all spoilers. Absorb the story and world as you would a good book or TV series.\n\nThe best way to describe the relationship of the main game and the DLC's attributes is using a real world analogy: If the main game (NC) is Hong Kong, then Phantom Liberty (Dogtown) is the Kowloon Walled City. If you think you knew Hong Kong, wait until you learn how insane the Kowloon Walled City was. Apart from the main themes of the Cyberpunk RPG like capitalism gone amok, I liked how the game raises a point how our mortality forces us to question our life choices and the meaning of life. And how time waits for no one.\n\nWhat really shocked me was how well written and how fun Phantom Liberty DLC was, and how it even surpassed the main story line in story quality, characters and world-building at times.\n\nRegarding lifepaths, personally I think corpo V is the best V since it narratively ties in very well with Arasaka and the price of being a corporate wage slave and the corpo opening scene is my personal favourite of all three, and it even gives the opportunity to show how bloodthirsty the world is and allow V's voice actor to show both strength and vulnerability in a single scene. Corpo V also has some great lines I love. But streetkid and nomad lifepaths also ties in very nicely with achieving your best, and the finding your family in life respectively. Each lifepath also gets 1 unique mission. But ultimately the lifepaths is mostly for flavour and does not affect V's main story in significant ways.\n\nThis game affected me quite personally. Some parts I even cried, or even felt that visceral rage at the injustice or powerlessness of some characters, which no other game I played has ever done before. Wonderful voice acting, character design, character animation, fun combat, music, world building. The last time I felt the same way was The Last Of Us released almost a decade ago, and that really got me to seeing video games seriously as a new emerging medium for good stories. And good stories do not necessarily must have happy endings, but good ones meant to provoke thought and feelings, and the writers understood that incredibly well.\n\nI played Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines, The Longest Journey, Dreamfall and somehow I feel that they taken the best parts of those games which are flawed in their own ways (some more than others) and put it into Cyberpunk 2077 and the DLC. Really helps that you get to pilot a robot in a point and click adventure style reminiscent of the Longest Journey. I was impressed that the DLC has that Cynosure horror level which also surprised me, a nod to their ability to integrate the psychological horror of Alien Isolation. Perhaps I'll go so far as to say it surpasses the quality and dread you will feel from the \"Ocean House Hotel\" level within Vampire the Masquerade Bloodlines. Not to mention Judy's cabin mission and underwater level is unforgettable.\n\nThe music in this game is fantastic. Even the character creation menu has its own theme song, and that is one of my favourite pieces. There is even a Chopin piece played by Arasaka's sister, a complete break from the usual electronic or rock music played in the BGM and in world music. That should tell you how awesome the music is. You even get to hear some of Silverhand's band Samurai's rock music pieces. There is a whole station playing songs from Nina Kraviz as you drive through Night City. She even appears as a minor ripperdoc character, which is ironic because she is a trained dentist while V makes an offhand remark to Viktor that they feel like being at a dentist's.\n\nThis game had characters that talked like human beings, have their own fears and desires which drive their characters which drive the story. Cherami Leigh has delivered one of the best performances in this game as V, and she has acting range, from joy to anger to fear and despair, you'll feel every moment of it. It certainly helps that Keanu Reeves plays Johnny Silverhand and V's wingman, and is with you almost throughout the entire story, and it would be a completely different game without him throwing his opinions, grows as a character and has his plot brings in the same existential questions about the nature of consciousness as Soma did. I expected Idris Elba to become Stringer Bell from the Wire, but what I saw was a restrained performance of a conflicted and world weary government agent, but in a way that is realistic and still ultimately human. Carla Tassara as Judy really performed and gave one of the most heartbreaking and real performances I felt in a video game ever in one of the scenes, felt too close to home at one point that I had to stop and take a breather. Erica Lindbeck as Misty in both the main game and DLC as V's mother figure had her moments as well, especially in the storage room outside the El Coyote Cojo Bar (another extremely real scene) and also at the ending of the DLC on the staircase. Michael Gregory as Johnny Mnemonic's Spider inspired Viktor Vektor delivers some great scenes as V's father figure in the main game and DLC. The scene where Arasaka Sr and Jr are fighting in Japanese is on another level, like you are watching a forbidden family drama unfold in a foreign language. There are many more voice actors that bring in their best in this, so it is best you experience their performances yourself.\n\nThey got into some deserved criticism over game breaking bugs or over-promising in their marketing. But at this point, I think it just became irrelevant in hindsight with the eventual fixes and expectations becoming re-balanced after COVID. Also helped that the Cyberpunk anime on Netflix and DLC attracted new players who were previously uninterested in the game, and see the game for what it is: a masterpiece that needed more time for polish, minor features and fixes. They did not compromise on the story and characters and acting and world building, and that everything technical can always be patched in the end.\n\nIt is a shame that the REDengine it runs on will no longer be used in the next Cyberpunk and choosing Unreal instead: this game alone proves it can be used for horror, RPGs (Vampire the Masquerade cough cough with safe areas), racing etc.\n\nI don't know how the team in CD Projekt Red pulled this off, but thank you for making a piece of art that will surely be remembered fondly for generations.\n\nThis review is borderline rambling because I'm speaking from the heart for the most part. It's better you experience it first hand yourself instead of watching someone else play it over YouTube because there is much more depth and beauty in this game that should be experienced first hand. If you're still skeptical, I can only quote Silverhand in Keanu Reeves's best scene in the game as he delivers his monologue (or manifesto? hehe), followed by his best line in the game: \"You still don't see it. But you will one day.\" Every time I think about the ending of the DLC, see my world I live in and read the papers, sometimes that quote pops up now in my head reminding me how Silverhand is ultimately right in the end.", "timestamp_created": 1722182621, "timestamp_updated": 1722228929, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 83, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.831611454486846924", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170426469": {"recommendationid": "170426469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198362705042", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 311, "playtime_at_review": 909, "last_played": 1723388528}, "language": "english", "review": "\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u266b I Really Want to Stay at Your House \u266b\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u26aa\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2800\u2590\u2590 \u2800\u25ba\u258f \u2800\u2800\u2500\u2500\u25cb\u2500\u2004\ud83d\udd0a \u28001:10 / 4:07 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u1d34\u1d30\u2699 \u2750 \u228f\u2290", "timestamp_created": 1721591331, "timestamp_updated": 1721591761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 113, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790325403213500977", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171273290": {"recommendationid": "171273290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198286523250", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5603, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5603, "last_played": 1721655926}, "language": "english", "review": "There is a certain threshold of playtime after which this game starts to affect your vocabulary, and the endings to both the main game and DLC might change your vision on life.", "timestamp_created": 1722583488, "timestamp_updated": 1722583488, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 24, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.72499769926071167", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171466507": {"recommendationid": "171466507", "author": {"steamid": "76561199040622100", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4278, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 893, "playtime_at_review": 4153, "last_played": 1722894635}, "language": "english", "review": "let me walk around with my dingaling stop putting underwear on me", "timestamp_created": 1722833190, "timestamp_updated": 1722833190, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 121, "weighted_vote_score": "0.68684762716293335", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170313155": {"recommendationid": "170313155", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043577873", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3241, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1688, "playtime_at_review": 2915, "last_played": 1723469022}, "language": "english", "review": "Outstanding!\n\nRarely have I ever been more appealed by a game right from the beginning.

Never will.\"\n\nCyberpunk 2077 is easily one of the best examples of a comeback story. We all remember the launch. It was not a good launch. I, however, did not really get invested until recently (Summer 2024 at the time of posting). I briefly attempted to play on an old rig, but it couldn't run the game above 40FPS on minimum settings. So, with a new rig and some free time, I gave Cyberpunk 2077 another try.\n\nI am so glad I did.\n\nThis game has affected me in such a way I don't think I'll ever be the same. From the gameplay, to the atmosphere, the story, the voice acting, the writing, all of it is absolutely nova. You can be whatever you want to be, but you're always on the same path: Night City Legend. I cannot do it a proper service here, so I have to implore you, reader, to buy the game. Give it a shot. I bought it at full price and the DLC at full price as well. Ah, the DLC!\n\nCyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty takes this immersive sim and spins it on its head into a spy thriller in an isolated zone of town, cut off from much outside help, left to fend for yourself and the few allies you can scrounge together. The better question, though, is will they stay that way for long?\n\nPL integrates perfectly into the main game, truly deserving the title of an expansion. If you got somebody the ultimate edition and didn't tell them explicitly, they probably wouldn't ever figure out that the PL content was not in the base game.\n\nAll in all, Cyberpunk 2077 is one of the best games I have ever played, and I intend to return to it for dozens of hours to come, at the very least. It has truly earned a 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1723273228, "timestamp_updated": 1723273228, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.583333313465118408", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171933500": {"recommendationid": "171933500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198182067513", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 4952, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2780, "playtime_at_review": 4952, "last_played": 1723423141}, "language": "english", "review": "CD Project Red is truly one of the best game development studios.

Suffice to say the launch version was a disaster. Many immersion breaking bugs, performance issues galore and inconsistent crashing. 99% of it fixed now with the seldom rare bug. The game still some what heavy graphically with it being what is, but is relatively well optimised at this point. Unfortunately the first person driving POV is still bad on most vehicles with the frame of reference being the dash board and car hood obscuring your vision and light exposure blinding the hell out of you in some areas of Night city. \n\nThe story is probably one of the best of the decade. There are often many instances of illusion of choice, but there are also some occasion where choices  matter and could lock you out of crucial story sections or provide different avenues of approach. The mixture of side jobs, gigs and police contracts add on to the lore, provide world build and sets the tone for the story. The writing is fantastic and voice acting is top notch; I recommend installing the mod for female V Japanese voicing. \n\nCombat doesn't have much difference in terms of the feel compared to version 1.0. The first person animations are good and responsive with gunplay and melee all feeling okay. Enemies can feel a little spongy if you aren't using sniper rifles, revolver or melee.  With 2.0 the skill system is massively improved (still quirky though), but still some glaring flaws that most don't heavily impact the game, but the choice for only allowing 1 stat point respec for the entire game is very questionable and many will find this choice extremely annoying.  Player armor got moved to cyberware while clothes now for the most part is cosmetic with some minor stat buffs on certain types of clothes,  Mostly, makes sense but i wish there was more cyberware slots for more build theory crafting. All in all i think most people will for the RPG systems and first person combat enjoyable. I think the combat system could use another overhaul, but CD Project Red are probably moving on at this point. \n\nAn added bonus to say is the the modding for this game is very mature now with alot of issues fixed by a mod and you can fine tune your game play experience with mods that are available. I say this, but a developer should never rely on the community to fix their game with mods, but i want to at least say kuddos that CD Project Red has provided tools for mod support. \n\n4 years late, but this game is finally where it should have been on launch.", "timestamp_created": 1722211838, "timestamp_updated": 1722211838, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.580799698829650879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169814914": {"recommendationid": "169814914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198957194761", "num_games_owned": 244, "num_reviews": 46, "playtime_forever": 33123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5322, "playtime_at_review": 22478, "last_played": 1723133530}, "language": "english", "review": "I FU*KING LOVE CP!", "timestamp_created": 1720922992, "timestamp_updated": 1720970265, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169839290": {"recommendationid": "169839290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058002513", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7922, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1270, "playtime_at_review": 5520, "last_played": 1723225451}, "language": "english", "review": "well, where to begin? i dont know!! so i'll simply leave u with this: BUSTING!! \ud83d\udd25 as good as it gets. out of a possible 10 stars, i rate this game and its dlc, an emphatic 10!!!", "timestamp_created": 1720952484, "timestamp_updated": 1720952484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563492059707641602", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171530646": {"recommendationid": "171530646", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112651977", "num_games_owned": 335, "num_reviews": 114, "playtime_forever": 4468, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 563, "playtime_at_review": 4468, "last_played": 1722924882}, "language": "english", "review": "WOW! this game was amazing...remember putting it off for a long time since it received so much backlash but man i'm glad i waited.

Cyberpunk is a good game. A very good game at that, but even in its best moments it struggles to live up to what was promised.\n\nStill, that was a while ago and the developers have done a remarkable job of bringing their project back from the messy state it launched in. Mind you, I never played the game at launch myself so I'm going off of footage and general discourse I've seen, but I think the improvements are clear. Namely in terms of stability, the game runs pretty well now. I was able to play the whole thing with minimal frame drops and I can't remember any crashes off the top of my head. There may have been one or two but again, I don't recall so at the very least it wasn't a frequent thing. I did run across a few bugs but nothing too impactful, certainly a far cry from the launch version!\n\nAs for the game itself, I enjoyed it quite a bit, though it has its issues. For example, the combat is satisfying but WAY too easy, the skill trees lose all relevance after you get the few perks you need for your build and worst of all, the game seems unsure of what genre it wants to be.\nIt claims to be an RPG but any RPG mechanics are bare bones at best and flat out absent at worst. It's only an RPG in the story and even then, your choices and life paths seem to have much less impact on the quests than you would think. Then you have mechanics like weapon crafting that you can essentially ignore for the entire runtime and lose absolutely nothing from having done so.\nAs such, Cyberpunk languishes in this \"in between space\" where it feels like CDPR wanted to make an RPG but gave up halfway through and just made an open world action story game instead, but forgot to rip out the old mechanics. Weird stuff.\n\nLuckily though, the things that Cyberpunk does right, it does VERY right. The atmosphere and art direction is stunning for one thing. Exploring Night City is constantly immersive and impressive to look at. The soundtrack also fits perfectly into that atmosphere, making a very complete and richly detailed world to sink into. Some of my favorite moments of my playthrough came from just looking around and taking in the neon grime and dystopian culture of the city.\n\nAnother positive, though I know I bashed it for being easy, would be the combat, which is held up by snappy gun and execution animations, solid sound design, and a willingness to allow player expression. Not a lot of it mind you, but enough. I picked a high mobility melee build and I gotta admit, I never really got tired of mowing down hapless thugs faster than they could react to me being there.\n\nThe last thing I want to bring up is the story, which seems to be a point of contention for a lot of people. For my part though, I liked it a lot! That being said, I think the main aspects of the story I enjoyed were definitely the characters and the banter between them. The obvious highlight being Silverhand. I went out of my way to scavenge as much dialogue as possible from him because I just really liked hearing the interactions between him and V. I won't get into spoilers here but I definitely think the story is one of the biggest highlights of Cyberpunk.\n\nThat all on the table, do I recommend the game? In its current state, absolutely. While it didn't hit me quite enough to call it one of my new favorites, I had a very good time playing it. It's for sure worth picking up if you enjoy open world games.

The world is full of so many small details that make it feel alive, no matter what location you are in. The missions are so well crafted and some of them really keep you on the edge of your seat, like that early one with Royce and the Maelstrom gang. What really makes the game for me is Johnny and relationship you build with him throughout the game. Can't obviously forget all the other dozen of amazing characters and the variety of romance options (there is only really two for me). This time I also decided to try a melee build, which was super fun and some netrunning after resetting my skills. Honestly you can go with anything and it'll be pretty fun. The combat doesn't get boring and these new finishers are so cool also. There's a lot of replay value with different choices, endings and builds. I honestly don't have much to complain about, aside from the bad launch the game had. You can also pet a cat. \n\nAlso, I love this quote from Misty at the end of the game \"We shouldn't fear change itself, but only who we might change into\"\n\n10/10 Would recommend highly", "timestamp_created": 1722216207, "timestamp_updated": 1722430621, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170728811": {"recommendationid": "170728811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010189852", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 5317, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5317, "last_played": 1721931961}, "language": "english", "review": "Took me quite a while to play the game it took a while for CDPR to eventually produce. It grew in my mind into quite fantastical shapes over the years, and very few of them particularly pleasant. Being bombarded with the sheer number of horror stories about Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s bugginess did not aspire a tad of confidence, not at all. In this regard, I can count myself lucky, having played what\u2019s ostensibly the final product, already after its saviour-like DLC\u2019s release. \n\nIt would be quite ridiculous of me to claim boldly that the game\u2019s shit, having put almost 90 hours into it. Mind you, I\u2019ve put 110h into The Witcher 3, which I was later quick to criticise on almost every aspect, so the pattern appears to repeat when it comes to CDPR\u2019s open world gigs so far. My criticism towards Cyberpunk doesn\u2019t stray far away from my criticism towards TW3 either \u2013 I consider the game \u2018overdesigned,\u2019 so to speak, with far too many systems and plot lines crammed onto a rather flimsy platform. \n\nThe prologue section is stellar, as always, as long as you venture away from the incessantly cinematic main plot. CDPR is still hell-bent on competing with Hideo Kojima on the sheer film-like quality of their games, although without anyone at CDPR boasting a flicker of Kojima\u2019s auteurial obsessions. I will refrain from dissecting the plot, because I believe many a more articulate storyfag has already creamed themselves over every tiny bit of it. Sure, it\u2019s reasonably stylish, although style alone would be a poor excuse for \u2018playing\u2019 a \u2018game.\u2019\n\nIt\u2019s a looter-shooter, for better or worse. You shoot the crap out of countless gangoons, bodyguards, robots, etc. There\u2019s little variation here, as the real monster is, as dull-minded people love to remind us, the humanity\u2026 This particular let down is rather confusing, as the tutorial section has you pass some cyberspace arenas, which could (and probably should) have been reused and furnished with more inventive dangers. Well, I guess it would be problematic to loot there. Guns are broadly grouped into a few categories, which matters little.\n\nIt does so, because you\u2019re free to respec your trait points at any time, functionally constrained only by your attribute points, which you can reset once. Trait lines within attribute trees govern everything, and since these are swappable, you have to ask yourself pretty simple questions \u2013 do you want to sneak around and snipe shit? Do you want to use cybermag- sorry, quickhacks? If you don\u2019t, don\u2019t bother putting points into Cool or Intelligence. That\u2019s it. You will still be able to put together a competent heavy weapons build, or become a samurai hopping through air. And you will still be able to pass all the sneaking sections. \n\nWhat, really? Well, yes. Cyberpunk 2077 location design is sickeningly inclusive, allowing for any of the two play styles permissible. You can crouch like a loser and do your lethal or, heh, non-lethal take downs, hacking cameras, turrets, whatever while you\u2019re at it \u2013 without putting a single point in either stealth or hacking. Your second option is to man up and to shoot everything liberally, punished for it in such benign ways that you quickly stop kidding yourself that stats matter. Also, please, play at least on Hard difficulty, lest you fall asleep.\n\nYou want to pump Tech and put as much cyberware in you as possible, given that there\u2019s no drawback whatsoever. The game ineffectively attempts to gate the best implants behind \u2018street cred,\u2019 which is an utterly amateurishly put together gauge that fills out to the brim in twenty hours, given that you finish side gigs. You will swim in cash as well, with cyberware being the biggest and most relevant money sink in the game, due to the way the game is very liberal in handing out perfectly serviceable guns for seemingly irrelevant tasks, not to mention the mountains of guns you loot. \n\nI\u2019m serious. Unless you\u2019re hell-bent on collecting all of the cars, very few of which matter much otherwise than regarding their looks, the money doesn\u2019t stop flowing in. Don\u2019t waste it on clothes either, they do nothing else than look silly. The few items of clothing that carry stat changes are honestly skippable. The only real passive statistic you equip comes from cyberware, in the shape of your armour stat growing as you equip more implants. Implants give the biggest differentiation in how to beef up your guy, also they have the usual Diablo-type tiny percentage-based boosts to random statistics, which add up benignly. It takes self-hypnotism to believe +1.7% reload speed is anything worth defending.\n\nThese are the role-playing bits in the game. Whether or not to redistribute your attributes once is the one choice & consequence in the game. Otherwise, it\u2019s all just a pretty spectacle for you to speed through, with your character gaining very tangible momentum very quickly. I saw the game described as an open-world Deus Ex and, well, it\u2019s somewhat fair. I\u2019d argue it\u2019s more of a Deus Ex than the Eidos Montreal games, since you don\u2019t glue yourself to walls as if you were playing Gears of War. Particularly the more story-wrapped content often suggests you do the hide-and-seek, which you may delude yourself to do. \n\nInvisibility isn\u2019t readily available from the start and there\u2019s no cheap Blink spell for you to cheese through the game with. There\u2019s just one (?) gun which allows you to shoot anyone without drawing popular attention, though, so it\u2019s a Deus Ex sans tranquilliser guns. Then you stop crouching and stand up, to throw one of a number of grenades around, to hop around the arena with double-jumps and physics-defying air dashes, slowing time and putting lead inside mooks. Then you do it again. And again\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s easy to like the experience, once you bash your head against the wall a few times. You grow to ignore the fact that very few things matter in this game and that it\u2019s just a big ass shooter with overgrown cutscenes. You forget that all the sensible location planning and content density takes place in Watson, again, just like it only took place in White Orchard in TW3. CDPR very much love to put so much time and effort in crafting a sterile world to look at, roll up their sleeves and do some heavy duty Game Design in the one section you\u2019re going to see in trailers ad nauseam, then to let some interns, uh, hone their craft on the rest of the game.\n\nYeah, I can recommend the Cyberpunk franchise of video games, naively hoping it ends after this instalment and the studio decides to produce something less loud and less massive, for our sakes. You can ninja dash through the air chucking grenades at ethnic minorities, it\u2019s a gem.", "timestamp_created": 1721937232, "timestamp_updated": 1721990331, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170527795": {"recommendationid": "170527795", "author": {"steamid": "76561198314681433", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 79, "last_played": 1721974901}, "language": "english", "review": "Absolutely fun, after cyberpunk edgerunners u really want a revenge for Davido", "timestamp_created": 1721709701, "timestamp_updated": 1721709701, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170438532": {"recommendationid": "170438532", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062072355", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 9526, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1773, "playtime_at_review": 7308, "last_played": 1722936650}, "language": "english", "review": "2019: This looks like such a great game\n2020: This could have been a great game\n2024: This is a great game", "timestamp_created": 1721604765, "timestamp_updated": 1721604765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170392460": {"recommendationid": "170392460", "author": {"steamid": "76561198390599018", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 75198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1163, "playtime_at_review": 72383, "last_played": 1723448563}, "language": "english", "review": "\"A thing of beauty, I know.\" This game will NEVER FADE AWAY \u2764\ufe0e", "timestamp_created": 1721562631, "timestamp_updated": 1721562631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169827789": {"recommendationid": "169827789", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152078645", "num_games_owned": 138, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 3873, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "playtime_at_review": 3634, "last_played": 1722347781}, "language": "english", "review": "Night City's a sprawl, chummer.

I also want to mention that some themes and musics are just to good.\nA little note that After the cyberpunk edgerunners anime which is really good in my opinion , In-game references against anime is cherry on top .\n\nEven the people who dont play cp77 would know that there are 3 paths you can choose at the begining of the game, they have some minor impacts in the story such as the first thirty minutes of the begining and adding some path related dialog options to feel like your following or used to follow that path you choosed \nSome players might say its changing nothing and has nothing to do in games progress and i dont agree with that much \nbecause i think its all about adding some persona to your playthrough rather then chaning the whole story arc just beacuse you were a corpo guy or used to hang out with nomads, it doesnt make sense.\n\nFor the gameplay part its really enjoyable and has a good amount of variety to make your own build an have fun with it\nThe combat system is to Satisfying that its making you wanna try different builds to get into combat with it \nAlso, as a car maniac i can say that there are some good looking ones and overall driving feels very nice.\nNot to mention that replayability is higher if you want to see different conclusions and differents way to get that conclusions. \n\nAs for the cons ; i would say that the main story is a bit short if you just rush through it, i havent encontered a lot of bugs like has to be around 5-10 within three hundered hours but man , its crashing a lot , almost once or twice in a day, dont know if its because i have tons of mods or not but it is what it is. \nit has four different difficulty options and i really dont like the way they work, if you increase your diff, your character takes more damage, deals less and complete opposite for the enemy, so it has nothing unique but you could say that this is not a game stands out with difficulties. other then some personal preferences i dont think cp77 has major cons anymore . \n\nLastly i think cyberpunk 77 is a prime open-world, action-adventure RPG game to give it a try at least once. \n\n\n \n\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1721591635,

But after suffering that existential crisis, I realized life goes on, so I had to fill my days with something else, I feel like I was invested in the story of the characters, the writing was most excellent, the game Design was Phenomenal, the Neon lights of night City, man I miss them. I wish I could experience this game once more, the Witcher 3 was also very good, but I feel like Cyberpunk was just something else, I can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s the Stunning Visuals or the different setting of the 21. Century but I preferred this game over the Witcher 3. The DLC was Story and gameplay wise also splendid but the Ending was not to my Personal liking but that is my Opinion so that that as you may.\n\nAll in all I recommend the game if you like an OpenWorld adventure genre if you don\u2019t like to do Fetch Quest\u2019s and just want to bash people\u2019s Head\u2019s in you may want to stick to something else, because as far I am concerned the Side Quest are what give\u2019s this kind of game it\u2019s character and realistically if you pay 30 to 80 Euros for this game you probably will do them to get more gametime out of it.\n", "timestamp_created": 1723140336, "timestamp_updated": 1723140336, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528301835060119629", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171685305": {"recommendationid": "171685305", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005773827", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10127, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1017, "playtime_at_review": 10127, "last_played": 1723125557}, "language": "english", "review": "Cyberpunk 2077: A Futuristic Journey Worth the Wait\n\nAs a passenger on the hype train leading up to Cyberpunk 2077\u2019s release, I eagerly awaited its arrival. However, the initial wave of negative reviews kept me at bay. CD Projekt Red (CDPR) worked tirelessly to address the game\u2019s issues, and even when Steam reviews turned \u201cvery positive\u201d with over 600k ratings, I hesitated due to my suboptimal PC setup. But finally, armed with a new PC featuring an RTX 4070 Ti Super, I took the plunge\u2014and it paid off.\n\nDuring my 168 hours of gameplay, I encountered only two minor bugs that necessitated reloading a previous save. Occasionally, vehicle entries felt awkward, but nothing game-breaking. What truly dazzled me was the graphics. Running the game smoothly at max settings and 2K resolution provided an immersive experience. It was like GTA, but with a futuristic twist and superior visuals. Yet, Cyberpunk 2077 offers more than eye candy. Its dialogue-heavy approach serves to immerse players in its dystopian world. For those pressed for time, a dialogue fast-forward option exists. The branching storylines lead to multiple endings, and the combat system offers diverse upgrade paths. Whether you favor stealth, hacking, blades, heavy weaponry, or sniping, you can tailor your playstyle.\n\nCritics have nitpicked the driving mechanics, but once you adapt to the style, control becomes predictable. Overall, Cyberpunk 2077 now stands in a state where full enjoyment awaits.

The decisions you take in the game makes you a few hard times where you don't really know what is really the good and what is the bad, which lead to the 5 possible endings (including the bonus DLC ending) for the game. \r\n\r\nOh and I couldn't forget the soundtrack! It's just amazing. Someone would say it's an eargasm. Like really, I get goosebumps every time I hear it.\r\n\r\nOverall, I enjoyed Cyberpunk: 2077 much more than I thought I would. I was little scared of what people were saying about it on it's release. But as time passed, the game became more and more stable. Now it's a really good game which deserves a second change from those who abandoned it on it's release. I've never wanted to play a game again as if it was a first time before. This game deserves a 10/10 from me.", "timestamp_created": 1721326404, "timestamp_updated": 1721326404, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171953636": {"recommendationid": "171953636", "author": {"steamid": "76561199477113075", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 6326, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2728, "playtime_at_review": 6326, "last_played": 1723393179}, "language": "english", "review": "\"The guy who saved my life\"", "timestamp_created": 1723455974, "timestamp_updated": 1723455974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525691688060760498", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "172019773": {"recommendationid": "172019773", "author": {"steamid": "76561199125556631", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 7656, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 36, "playtime_at_review": 7619, "last_played": 1723527841}, "language": "english", "review": "the best rpg of the last 10 years", "timestamp_created": 1723525651, "timestamp_updated": 1723525651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171988461": {"recommendationid": "171988461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198832315153", "num_games_owned": 154, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1024, "playtime_at_review": 5124, "last_played": 1723493635}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0412\u0441\u0451, \u0447\u0442\u043e \u043c\u044b \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u043c \u043f\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0447\u0438\u0442\u044c \u0437\u0434\u0435\u0441\u044c, \u0442\u0430\u043a \u044d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0438\u0437\u0434\u044b, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0451\u043c \u0432 \u043f\u043b\u043e\u0445\u043e\u043c \u0441\u043c\u044b\u0441\u043b\u0435.", "timestamp_created": 1723494612, "timestamp_updated": 1723494612, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171986603": {"recommendationid": "171986603", "author": {"steamid": "76561199193301390", "num_games_owned": 144, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 17423, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 17423, "last_played": 1712219772}, "language": "english", "review": "Johnny: So that\u2019s how it is.

For years before the game was out, I was an avid skeptic, just had the vibes from all the odd secrecy that something wasn't right. Things felt overly \"ambitious\" in scale and yet gameplay was rare, hidden behind closed doors, and not permitted from early reviews except for rare cases or just CDPR's own B-Roll iirc. Then launch happened and it was like an \"I told ya so\" moment. Saw the bugs and failed executions, had a laugh with buds then forgot about the game.\n\nCut to this year's Summer Sale, I saw this as one of the top sellers and decided to look into it and see what happened. Lotta patches, an expansion, other updates and I was somewhat impressed by the perspective turnaround so I though \"Eh what the hell, I'll give it a shot.\" I'm glad I did. This game has been a ton of fun, love the neon grimy atmosphere, the wacky augmentations and upgrades, messing around with driving, and the story's got a full grip on my attention even though I love messing with the side content for the most part.I am genuinely shocked by how much I have been enjoying this. \n \nThough, nothing is perfect. Bugs can still occur along with crashes which thankfully aren't common at all, dialogue choice are bad especially when you don't even say anything related to the prompt or it's provided in a completely opposite tone to what I expected. It's very jarring and irritating but otherwise, good game all around even though I'm still not finished but can safely recommend it as a former skeptic.", "timestamp_created": 1722621341,

chasing shadows instead of your dreams. That is what Cyberpunk 2077 presents to the player. You play as \"V\" the merc. Like Geralt of Rivia, V is not a character you create and can embody. They are their own person, and you can merely influence and mold the choices that THEY make throughout this depressing journey.\n\nThere are gameplay systems that will be familiar if you've played an open-world video game before and there are new and interesting systems that are unique to Cyberpunk 2077. My personal favorite playstyle is going the path of the Netrunner. You can hack enemy cyberware and cause mayhem without lifting a finger. It is an incredible experience that is best played rather than read about because words don't do it justice. Even within the netrunner builds there are many potential specializations that will set you apart from how other players might play the game. You can spread cyber-diseases and then cause mass explosions to kill upwards of five enemies in one single continuous attack, or you can control machinery that will do your bidding for you.\n\nOne particular playstyle that his game fails to support adequately, especially in the expansion \"Phantom Liberty\" is stealth. I cannot express how obnoxious it is for the game to shit on my build consistently for the set-piece allure of a subpar boss fight. The game does this quite a bit, and while I do understand the reasoning, it is insufferable to deal with. I had to respec multiple times in the middle of fights just so I could beat a boss because the game decided that the set-piece they're choosing to present was more important than my skill investments. While this is not a major issue, it is still worth mentioning.\n\nKeanu Reeves as \"Johnny Silverhand\" is an excellent casting choice. It is so excellent that I am dedicating an entire section of this review in praise of it. Anyone could have played Johnny Silverhand, but Keanu's interpretation is so unique that it transcends to a league of its own. He plays the raspy, indignant and selfish Rockerboy so incredibly well. It is a reward of its own to hear and see him in-game after completing a mission or while doing a gig. This is largely in part because he does not simply reinforce V's opinions or choices, but rather goes against them most of the time with his own views. This clash between the two main characters leads to very interesting conversations that significantly enhance the experience. He's not there to give you overt hints over puzzles or tips on how to beat a boss; he's his own man in your own body, and he does not mind calling you stupid if you make a choice that clashes with his own views. \n\nVisually, the game has to be seen to believed. The environments, the city, the outskirts, and the interiors are a marvel to the eyes. The artistic direction is so distinct that it is hard for me to compare it to a game that came before it. Naturally it takes a lot of inspiration from other IPs in the genre, but all of the elements lead to an amalgamation that is unique to this game.\n\nThe expansion, \"Phantom Liberty\" is also another fantastic addition to this already great game. While it does not reach the same heights as Blood & Wine, it still stands on its own. Phantom Liberty is not a \"post-game\" expansion, so much as it expands on the already existing story. I've not experienced many games that do this, since DLCs or expansions tend to be wholly separate from the main-game. All of this is to say, that you should absolutely buy the expansion on top of the main-game if you're considering purchasing Cyberpunk 2077. It is integral to V's story and it expands on the game's themes even more. \n\nWhen the credits roll, you are left not with wanting more, but with a feeling of finality. Whatever choice you make, V's story comes to an end. Even as I'm writing this review, I miss the ignorant, arguably selfless, and ill-fated merc. What starts out as a quest for mere survival ends up being an impactful story about inevitability, grief and the juxtaposition of living a quiet, simple life or going all in and exploding in a \"blaze of glory.\" All of this occurs in a society that takes the negative aspects of American culture and ramps it up to an extreme. Perhaps the world of Cyberpunk 2077 is not worth fighting for, but V's life definitely is.", "timestamp_created": 1722476976, "timestamp_updated": 1722562731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171157694": {"recommendationid": "171157694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198277760820", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 2154, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 164, "playtime_at_review": 2038, "last_played": 1722886707}, "language": "english", "review": "Its a good game, but sadly its nothing compared to the Witcher 3.

Once [i]Cyberpunk[/i] got going, I was hooked. Doing all the gigs, as many side quests as I could, playing through both the main story and [i]Phantom Liberty[/i]. There are funny quests and disturbing ones. Plenty of hard decisions to make, especially in PL.\n\nI didn't play the game at launch, but playing it now seems to be a more refined experience. Playing for an extended amount of time highlights the game's bugs more, but there was really only one instance where I had to reload an autosave which occurred seconds before a bug I encountered that actually prevented progress (although the reload only worked slightly).\n\nThe different ways to spec and play your character are a lot of fun. I like to go for a jack-of-all-trades approach, and while this means I couldn't fully upgrade any one skill tree, there were only a (relative) handful of dialogue options I missed out on or locked doors I couldn't get through. Some playstyles seemed less viable than others, but maybe this is just due to how I tend to play games - less up close and personal, more ranged.\n\nThe dialogue trees are fairly varied and provide plenty of options for conversations. Inevitably, I was bound to run into a (relative) handful of situations where the choice I picked didn't quite seem to line up with what was actually said. There's also a mission here or there where I felt like some of the choices I could've been making were made for me. However, I rarely felt like I lacked choice. Often times I had to pause the game to think about how I actually wanted to proceed.\n\nThe base game's story is an interesting existential dilemma. PL's story is an engaging spy thriller. The two don't necessarily gel that well. I'd played the base game for 65 - 80 hours before finally starting PL, and the way that starts is a far cry from the tone the base game had been putting forward. Things start to even out in the middle before spiking again at the end, and the side content is more aligned to the base experience, but it was a little jarring. That's not to say PL is bad, but it switches things up in a way that didn't feel totally cohesive to me.\n\nAt this point in time, I think this is definitely a game worth getting into. I haven't put this much time into a game in a long time (much less a single-player experience). If you're like me and are prone to getting sucked into open-world games, this one is worth investing in.", "timestamp_created": 1721111785, "timestamp_updated": 1721111908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169956320": {"recommendationid": "169956320", "author": {"steamid": "76561199696286278", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 111, "playtime_at_review": 7844, "last_played": 1723514152}, "language": "english", "review": "best game ever;)\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u281b\u281b\u281b\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285f\u2801\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2808\u2804\u2808\u2819\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28df\u2804\u2804\u28e0\u28f6\u28f7\u28e6\u28e0\u2844\u2804\u2804\u2808\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287b\u281f\u2804\u28b0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28fd\u2889\u2801\u2804\u281a\u2819\u283b\u28bf\u28bf\u28ff\u2840\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c3\u2806\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2880\u2846\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2820\u2833\u2803\u284f\u2808\u2899\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u282f\u2804\u2813\u28e4\u28e6\u2876\u28bf\u2807\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2844\u285c\u2804\u2804\u280c\u286b\u28ff\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2863\u2801\u2804\u2804\u280b\u28e4\u28c4\u2840\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28a3\u288d\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2806\u28ff\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281b\u281b\u2809\u2819\u2882\u28e0\u2856\u2840\u2804\u2813\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2890\u28fe\u28f7\u2840\u2804\u2804\u2818\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u285d\u2844\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2819\u28bf\u28e7\u2840\u2804\u2804\u2880\u28bf\u28ff\r\n\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2840\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28c7\u2801\u28c0\u2840\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2830\u28ff\u2842\u2804\u2801\u2804\u2808\u28ff", "timestamp_created": 1721080182, "timestamp_updated": 1721080182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169954060": {"recommendationid": "169954060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022031918", "num_games_owned": 36, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8228, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8228, "last_played": 1720280271}, "language": "english", "review": "Considering early reviews of this game, I sure am glad I started playing this game after Phantom Liberty.

The bad press about the bugged launch had me in no rush 2. My PC hadnt been updated in the last 8 years so I was highly doubtful it would have been able to run it. \r\n\r\nAnd now I have my new Rig I was eagerly awaiting the next time it went on sale which was summer sale and I do not regret the purchase in the least!! So much so after I had completed the base game I went and purchased the expansion and finished that too. \r\n\r\nIs the game flawless with no issue? No, but i didnt experience anything that was run ending and sometimes I would have an issue where a texture did not load in and I could solve it simply by reloading a save. The game only crashed on me in 1 spot out of the 100 hours of play time as of this review and given how grand a scale this game is that did not phase me.\r\n\r\nWhats so good about this game? Many things!\r\nThe World: its huge and lived in and you can very easily get lost in it in a good way and there is so many side stories and optional content you can take part in and all of it is voice acted and they tell stories of their own with some contributing to the grander story at play.\r\nThe Main Story: The Main story that drives this game forward is incredible and you as the player want to find out more about what is going to happen next almost too much that you might miss some of the brilliant content just outside the main stories scope! There is more then 1 way this story ends and how you explore this world and story will impact what you decide to do.\r\nThe Gameplay: Its Fast and furious if you want it be or more stealthy and methodical if you choose to go that route, I found the in game skill trees all had interesting draw cards some stronger then others but I never felt annoyed about having to slog through more fights (I completed the game on hard). I will say the car controls are pretty awful but there is some mods that make it much more manage able I completed my runs vanilla and it wasnt that bad my vehicle of choice was any of the bikes in 3rd person and scooting through traffic.\r\nOverall this game exceeded my expectations and I am looking forward to more stories unfolding in night city in the future.

The details to the cityscape also tell their own story, the reports you find while on gigs open the world and let you learn more about the ins and outs of the world naturally. \r\n\r\nPlus, I've been getting around gun combat by making a more stealth/netrunning build. Most of the time, I don't need to shoot a single bullet. So, now I don't even really have to worry about sucking at combat. I will also say the music is great, both the radio music and environment music. The only issues I've seen is the occasional NPC T-Pose or flail around while talking to me, but I find it as hilarious, and it hasn't happened during any gigs or jobs to ruin the moment. Also, sometimes I randomly get pushed about 5 feet away.

I personally felt satisfied with my initial 80$ purchase cuz I trusted a good name studio like CD project red to continue updating the game. Playing the early release of the game, I could tell just how passionate the designers were about every little detail in the game. It's so rare to see this kind of care put into a game.\n\nAfter many updates I can say that I was not wrong in my trust with CDprojectred. The latest update of this game is so close to being a masterpiece. I was such a huge fan of the Witcher 3 and all its little details and attention to all parts of the world. Thank you CDproject red for bringing that same magic to the world of cyber punk. I hope you will please continue to update this game. I love it so much its one of my favourite games.

The game launch was unfortunate, but years later, the 2.0 update finally feels like the polished game we\u2019ve all wished and loved for Cyberpunk to be.\n\n10/10 Would recommend and HIGHLY recommend the Phantom Liberty expansion pack. It\u2019s a must! In my opinion, the DLC is even more exciting and fun than the already so lovable base game.\n\nThe story is amazing and with all the choices you make that impact your experience makes every decision even more rewarding.\n\nThe game offers you so many ways to handle combat. You could rock a Katana and throwing knife and go full Ninja, or get a revolver and dress up like a sherif, use futuristic smart weapons, or even hack your way through by causing your enemies cyberware to malfunction. The options are endless!\n\nI will admit though that while there are endless ways to customize your character, you pretty much never see your drip because you\u2019re almost always first person unless you\u2019re driving, in which case you can switch between 1st person and 3rd person. At this point you\u2019re playing dress up just for the npc\u2019s. Also, from first person pov, you\u2019ll find yourself always wearing the same short sleeved shirt regardless if you\u2019re wearing a fancy suit, or a goofy wife beater.

I got the game because it was on sale and I recently got an oled monitor and a gpu upgrade and figured, why not try it? I\u2019ve devoted my entire summer into this game, it lives in my head rent free. The show is great too, watch edgerunners if you plan on buying the game. Anyways I wanna go over my experience with the game. Night city is so bustling with life, the whole scenery is beautiful especially with path tracing, and the gameplay, oh boy the gameplay. I never knew how varied the game was. I came into it thinking it was a simple basic shooter game and now I run a hacker net runner ninja build with throwing knives and sick movement tech, and I already plan on a second play through with a different life path and sandy build. The gameplay is super fun and really replayable, I have so many hours just roaming the world killing random street thugs. The story is amazing, I absolutely love the voice actors for V and the dynamic between V and Johnny is so entertaining to watch. Phantom Liberty blows me away from its story and characters and I have barely even made it through it. I am really glad to see CD Projekt Red have polished and put so much love into this game to really give what they promised after so many years, it deserves its Labor of Love award, and to anyone skeptical about the game, buy it. It\u2019s even worth it at full price, there\u2019s so much replayability and it makes me excited for the sequel!

When it came out I was just looking at it and saw how much ppl complained, (probably with right) because it was completely bugged (pushed to fast to get release date probably?). However it came back on my radar 6 months ago so looked into it. Started to read almost all bugs have been resolved, so you'd get a good game maybe? So I bought it and simply waited with playing, just wanted in my library, until I had some time and check it. SUCH A BAD DECISION... \n\nThis game is just so AMAZING. Well for me. I am an avid GTA fan. This is something else though. You have the freedom of GTA as well as the city feelings. This game actually offers more, because you can adjust your character to ANY playstyle. So we got skills and then we got weapons we can customize. You can combo some guns with certain abilities but if you like to go close up: Get a Katana or throwing knives... The possibilities are ENDLESS!! You can follow the story or do seperate missions or just do whatever! \n\nWhat surprised me the most is the size. Cause not only is the city very big, it also has several layers on certain points. So you drive on a road. But somehow underneath is another layer of life, driving cars. And sometimes under that as well?!\n\nAnywayz this game is like no other I've played yet and I absolutely LOVE it. I already know I will buy the DLC one I finished the 1st run. But I also know I will start again to play in a completely different way! Loading times btw are very fast! Tonx of guides available, also because it is an \"older\"  game, with 3 years.

So was I, and the wait was worth it. As of 2.0, this game is a [i]tour-de-force.[/i] Unquestionably one of the best games ever made.[/h2]\n\nThe story goes that internal shakeups bogged down the development, and the devs said point-blank that the game would take another two years to be ready. In drops the 2.0 update to fix [b]everything,[/b] just under two years from release. Seems they knew what they were talking about.\n\nThe game that exists now is one of the most satisfying RPGs I've ever played; unquestionably worth standing right next to the greats like KOTOR2, Mass Effect, Dragon Age, Fallout: NV, and its stablemate Witcher 3. If you liked Deux Ex in particular, stop reading right now and play this, immediately. This is Deus Ex's greatest inheritor, and it has 10+ years on Human Revolution and nearly 30 on the original to learn from and perfect the gameplay and system.\n\nExcellent writing, themes, characters, choices, combat, plots and subplots, all founded on a deep, authentic-feeling and very immersive sandbox, with a tight gameplay loop with no cruft to perfectly wrap it all up. Being drawn into the world is effortless, and developing V's personality and outlook is potent and convincing, including many dialogue choices whose purpose is just to explore V's character for its own sake, making this a \"role-playing game\" in the truest sense. The story and plots and characters have incredible depth; and twists and turns will surprise you constantly, tugging your heartstrings or rewarding you with massive catharsis, just as Witcher 3 did so well.\n\nMechanical gameplay progression (level-ups and cybernetic implants) are meaningful choices with satisfying payoffs, and build and playstyle variety is so far through the roof it flew straight through it and out into space. No game has compelled me to make so many different characters so fast [b]just[/b] because I thought of a new playstyle or skill synergy that seemed [i]so cool[/i] I had to try it. 450 hours in in two three-month-long stretches and I can tell: I will be playing this game for [b]years,[/b] or even [b]decades,[/b] and still enjoying it.\n\n[h2]If your computer can run this by any means, even on the lowest settings, and you like deep, excellently written RPGs with satisfying combat and character exploration, don't hesitate.

Now the game has alot of potential to be one of the best games I ever played, I would strongly recommend it for these reasons:\n\n1) The story and the side quests are immersive. The decisions you make are influential to your overall experience. Side quests can steer main quests and there are lines which are heard if you completed them in specific order, this shows how well written the game is.\n2) A banging soundtrack and a radio that fits the theme of the game. \n3) The details in the skill, attribute tree and mods are suitable for versatile play styles, stealth or Leave no witnesses.\n4) Relatively Large map size and Dense. Portals are there for unlocked locations but I prefer to drive instead. \n5) Shops for food,drinks, guns, meds,hacks even junk.\n6) There are many uncovered secrets which needs more exploring.\n7) Side characters have amazing lines and quests, My favorite are Judy and Jackie.\n\nRecommendations :\n1) More interaction between the side characters with each other.\n2) Pistol selection pool is more than other weapons ( unless you love pistols then its a plus :D )\n3) More life path special quests, weapons ,clothes,mods ( streetkid- street market mods or boosters , corpo - Corporation mods like takemura's or Adam's, Nomad - Clan mods, more vehicle interactions like jackie's and V's car).\n4) specific car or bike races after Claire side quest. recurring boxing tournaments based on body level or mods types, Hackathons based on intelligence level or mods types. Gun range tournaments based on reflexes.\n5) I wished for a multiplayer coop quests like GTA V heists but sadly we never see it.  :(  \n\nCons:\n1) You will need a pc with above average specs if you want to enjoy the details put into it.\n2) There are bugs but they are way less compared to when the game launched. \n3) Might be too much for sensitive groups, gets too dark sometimes. (Its good for me cause it adds depth to the story)\n4) There is a big leap between the difficulty levels of main quests. Side quests is your go to level up.\n6) IMPORTANT: You will find free external mods. There are a lot of good mods out there but I wish the game had them already instead of looking outside. I recommend installing the mods before playing the game as the take your game experience to another level but make sure that they don't harm your computer or your default game files. \n\nthe game without external mods: 8/10\nthe game with external mods: 9/10", "timestamp_created": 1721520589, "timestamp_updated": 1721520589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504950463771820068", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171373822": {"recommendationid": "171373822", "author": {"steamid": "76561199449756565", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9125, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1667, "playtime_at_review": 7458, "last_played": 1723497596}, "language": "english", "review": "i have so much time in this game and i have played through it so many times and am still finding new things and ways to make the game much harder", "timestamp_created": 1722711036, "timestamp_updated": 1722711036, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.504716992378234863", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170250409": {"recommendationid": "170250409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004336874", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11597, "last_played": 1721532370}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a masterpiece.

It has an interesting story and characters, beautiful world, compelling side quests, and a lot of fun weapon variety and play styles. The story is largely linear but does give the player some control towards and decisions that affect the ending.\n\nHaving completed it 100%, I would say it holds up best if you stick just to the main story and a few of the side plots. While it is an open world, the amount of play time available and interest present in the world is quite low for one. Roaming around you won't find much to do besides go on the occasional crime spree or gawk at the beautiful world.\n\nThe NCPD scanner gigs scattered about are incredibly repetitive - 90% of them you just go to a location, shoot a couple heads, and collect a random item. They were clearly added as an attempt to make the world feel more lively with random events, but they end up just being feeling like a chore.\n\nAs for the open world... it feels dead. The highways and streets feel empty with cars in the distance that disappear as you get closer. Random events and NPC interactions aren't present to any interesting extent - besides random enemies standing around or the aforementioned NCPD gigs. Once you've completed your tasks in a given area, there isn't any real reason to ever go back there. After completing the main story and other quests, there doesn't seem any reason to revisit Night City at all.\n\nThere's also still a decent amount of annoying, small bugs present. Your vehicles can be spawned in the ground, or you won't be able to get onto your tipped over bike. Or you car gets stuck and you have no choice but to load a previous save, since the game won't let you get out or move. I really didn't encounter anything game breaking, though.\n\nWhere the game does shine is the weapon variety and play styles. If you don't go out of your way to experiment and challenge yourself, though, you'll see the game is absurdly easy. I barely changed my weapons or upgraded my bioware until I was close to completing the game and DLC 100%. Weapon mods and the large variety of guns, melee weapons, and bioware are super fun to experiment with though.\n\nWhile I've been largely critical, that's mostly just because it's tagged as an open-world RPG when I think it is really best played as a linear shooter.

"language": "english", "review": "This game wasn't released so well, had so many problems along the way, got so much attention in a bad way that affected its market, and it's come a long way now, but the devs didn't just leave it behind, with constant updates and patches, I can confidently say that this is one of the absolute best games you can find in the whole history of gaming, and a great example of how games should be made and released and taken care of. this'll be a long review but I plan to try to review the game in different perspectives. It will be completely spoiler free. Hope you enjoy. \n\n[LORE]  \nFirst up let's talk about the story and the lore. I never expected it to have such a huge world and plot, it's amazing, the details and everything. it seems like it's taken from a novel series, it's THAT deep and well written. You as the main character V, make decisions and those decisions are important, they matter and will determine how the story goes on. you can interact with characters and the world your own way by choosing voice lines and deciding different stuff. All this not only determine your fate, but also the characters' fates, and your relationships with them, and of course the overall story and its progress. \nSo basically, Cyberpunk 2077 totally immerses you in its lore by giving you options like these and some very difficult decisions you'll have to make throughout the game. However, you'll actually completely get what I said up here IF you play the side quests and try to complete at least some of them. This is one of those games you really shouldn't rush. the side quests are totally worth it. worth everything. \nThere are multiple side quests that some go very deep and are attached to important characters, so those side quests also determine your relations with those certain important characters, such as Judy, River and Panam. \n\n[GAMEPLAY]\n The game is in first person, but you can change it to third person when driving. There are all kinds of weapons that you can modify too. You can complete missions in any way you want really. You can be stealth or go ham and get that LMG out and slaughter em all, and don't worry it doesn't necessarily affect your ending, however you must be careful what you do in certain missions and actually listen to characters' requests and guides, otherwise if you for example kill a certain npc in a certain Judy side quest, you can no longer have any side quest with Judy, but other than that in the open world and in most story or even side missions, killing enemies, being stealthy, leaving them alive or anything else doesn't really matter that much. see what suits your style.\nYou can drive cars and bikes and each are very different from each other in terms of how you drive them and the places you can go with them. you'll really sense that once you try some different cars. \nYou can customize your character completely, even after creating it at the beginning of the game. clothes, appearance, everything pretty much. \n\n[GRAPHICS AND OPTIMIZATION]\nThe graphics are what you would expect, amazing, they've done a very good job with detailing the city, the graphics, textures and models. The options really let you change a lot in the video and graphics section based on your needs and desires for better image or better performance. Don't get too lost in it in the beginning though. You'll figure out what settings best suit you and your computer specs after playing the game a little why and testing things. \nI for example, have an RTX 2060, AMD Ryzen 5 3600, with 16 GB of 3200mhz ram, and I play on a HDD, on a 1080p 60hz monitor. I chose the High preset settings, but improved some other settings for better image, and I get like 60+ stable FPS. I didn't choose this right in the beginning, I chose it after like 5 hours into the game and testing different settings throughout the game. My game had lags at first, it eventually got fixed after some changes in the settings. \nOverall, the graphics and optimization of the game is pretty good.\n\n[LENGTH]\nThe game's quite long. I played pretty much all the important side quests with important characters alongside the main quests, and it all took me about 45 hours. I'd say it could take you somewhere between 20 - 80 hours depending on how many side quests you finish and how much you explore. I didn't finish some side quests because they didn't involve any important characters and didn't contribute to the story much, but played everything else so clean and completely. \n\n[AUDIO AND SOUNDTRACK]\nMasterpiece, unique, literally can't say enough about how good the audio and soundtrack of the game is and how much it adds to the game and experience. \nNOTHING wrong with any of it, absolutely perfect. perfect. Just for the record, I've got all the soundtrack on my phone and listen to them, and right now as I'm writing this, I'm listening to it on Steam thanks to them giving it for free after purchasing the game. \n\n[EDDIES]\nGot it with a very good 50% discount, but it's definitely worth the base price, completely. \n\n[BUGS}\nThe game still has so many bugs and they can get annoying. They were many in the first few hours of the game but gradually got better. One other thing is that usually when I played more than 4 hours without a break, I would see some very random bugs and issues that could get so annoying, but I guess it makes sense kinda. The game is huge, gotta give it a break. \nBesides that, I didn't really notice any real bad bugs or issues in the game or the settings. This game is polished. \n\n[RATNG]\n2077/10 Can't go wrong, one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. \n\n[TIPS]\nIf you've read everything so far, I really appreciate your time and concern, so here's some tips I understood during the game that will free you of any need to external guides, and hopefully help you have an experience as great as mine. \n\n1. Save your game once in a while, sure the game has auto save but to really get the most of the game and missions and the lore, sometime you'll find yourself in need to replay a certain part of the game. try to save your game whenever you feel like something important is gonna happen or you're gonna take an important decision. you'll never know, you might need it. it will save your time. \n\n2. Play the side quests, trust me. even if you have to force yourself to do it, just give em a try at least, and I'm talking about the important side quests that the main characters give you. Judy, Panam, River, Claire, Delamain, Kerry, Paralezes, these are the characters you really shouldn't ignore. If you do, I can assure you you'll miss out on half of the game, in terms of everything. \n\n3. Be good with Johnny and he can be the most trustworthy character in the game, for the most part. sometimes when you find yourself struggling to make an important decision, Johnny is always there and talks to you. listen to him, he's not all that heartless terrorist you might think. Just don't ignore him, hear him out, sure he can sometimes say dumb things that just don't make sense to do considering the fact that you're not him, and certainly don't blindly go with him if you're completely sure about what you wanna do and what you believe is right, but I'm talking about the moments that not even you know what to do, when you're in complete confusion, lost. Listen to him, you usually won't regret it. This can be true about some other characters and situations too.

The writing is excellent, the graphics are extremely good, and so is the art style. I know the game started out rough (I played on launch day), but it came so, so far. It gets even better with mods, too. CP2077 is one of the only games I've purchased more than once; on launch day for Xbox One S, and on Steam during the 50% sale.

I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just, watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. loaded into the game, made my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you were supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he helped me.

some time to put down my thoughts on this game properly. I've played the game twice once at launch and I just wrapped up the second playthrough, both were 100% completion with all the endings.\n\nAt launch the game was a mess, but I lucked out with a good pc so was able to enjoy it for what it was with the believe of what could be. As there was a true once in a life experience hiding behind all the T poses and car crashes. Back then I already loved the game and saw it as one of my favorites ever but it was nothing to recommend at the time due to its rough shape (or shape at all if you were trying to play on last gen consoles). I can now wholeheartedly recommend this game. The characters, the story paths, the city, the fun builds it all just checks out and it all comes together as one of the most immersive experiences I've ever had. Just sitting down and looking at the city while listening to some music in game can just be so calming after a heartbreaking experience.\n\nPhantom Liberty put things in a cinematic overdrive and lead to some choices where I still don't know what the right choice would have been. Normally that is something I'd heavily dislike but given how there are no real winners in Night City I'd say it fits very well and just gives me more time to think about it all.\n\nConclusion would be a very strong recommendation for a game that had an abysmal launch, but got fixed up to where it should be. The game still has bugs but none are game breaking from my experience and even though I'm glad they fixed it up, it should have never released in the state that it did. Also to truly understand how beautiful the game is you'd need a fairly beefy pc where the true potential only unlocks with path tracing enabled. Now all there is to do is wait for a follow up, and in a few years time another full completion.\n\n~ Today was a good day.", "timestamp_created": 1716743072, "timestamp_updated": 1716743072, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768476605415344238", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "165621313": {"recommendationid": "165621313", "author": {"steamid": "76561198442003690", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 149, "playtime_forever": 5465, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 26, "last_played": 1720966553}, "language": "english", "review": "No one is Going to read this review so i want to confess that i am gay .", "timestamp_created": 1716060249, "timestamp_updated": 1716060249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 548, "votes_funny": 252, "weighted_vote_score": "0.751032471656799316", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "166495261": {"recommendationid": "166495261", "author": {"steamid": "76561197976794377", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 1296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 599, "last_played": 1718668969}, "language": "english", "review": "I found my love in \u0421yberpunk, but alas, she doesn\u2019t like girls(((( Panam Palmer, you are my disappointment...I only play the female character in this game, I wanted to become closer friends with her, but she rejected me\ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2d", "timestamp_created": 1717286011, "timestamp_updated": 1717286011, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 167, "votes_funny": 83, "weighted_vote_score": "0.74705052375793457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169589932": {"recommendationid": "169589932", "author": {"steamid": "76561199708876092", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1253, "last_played": 1720785262}, "language": "english", "review": "Cyberpunk 2077 is the game that became more than just a masterpiece: It's a new life style, a new category... and a LEGEND!", "timestamp_created": 1720701779, "timestamp_updated": 1720701848, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 81, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.737963020801544189", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "166939930": {"recommendationid": "166939930", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085763321", "num_games_owned": 297, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 694, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 694, "last_played": 1717244588}, "language": "english", "review": "I will leave the cat here, so that everybody who passes by can pet it and give it a thumbs up and awards.\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000\uff0f\uff1e\u3000\u3000\u30d5\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000\u3000| \u3000_\u3000 _ l\n\u3000 \u3000\u3000 \u3000\uff0f` \u30df\uff3fx\u30ce\n\u3000\u3000 \u3000 /\u3000\u3000\u3000 \u3000 |\n\u3000\u3000\u3000 /\u3000 \u30fd\u3000\u3000 \uff89\n\u3000 \u3000 \u2502\u3000\u3000|\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000\uff0f\uffe3|\u3000\u3000 |\u3000|\u3000|\n\u3000| (\uffe3\u30fd\uff3f_\u30fd_)__)\n\u3000\uff3c\u4e8c\u3064\n", "timestamp_created": 1717857217, "timestamp_updated": 1717857217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 693, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.727769255638122559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169204174": {"recommendationid": "169204174", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075413979", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 327, "playtime_at_review": 1478, "last_played": 1723450848}, "language": "english", "review": "Nobody will read my review so I Will Eat 1 Tablespoon of ketchup For Every Like this gets.", "timestamp_created": 1720326823, "timestamp_updated": 1720326823, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 188, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702317535877227783", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169380517": {"recommendationid": "169380517", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995820559", "num_games_owned": 811, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1347, "playtime_at_review": 6949, "last_played": 1723361964}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game.

Like I already knew \u201cNever fade away\u201d, we hear the Samurai version many times in the game, but I wasn't ready for this. Best timing for the best song to describe this game. Because, in the end, we lose everything-hope, dreams, even our lives, depending on the ending you choose, but you learn to not look at it with envy, regret, hate or remorse, you just accept and cherish what happened, reaching the acceptance stage. And no matter how tough it was, the best part is that \u201cwould never fade away\u201d. The eye to detail in this game was consistent throughout, the end credits were just the cherry on the top.\n\nI wasn't ready for how good this game was. Writing, character design, gameplay, my favourite non rockstar crafted open world city, Johnny Silverhand, the father of all jerks but, in the end, the man \"who saved my life\".\nMany modern day western devs should learn from CDPR and write these types of characters, flawed, but relatable. They run away from making things controversial but all they achieve is to create forgettable experiences. Looking at you, Starfield, but you aren\u2019t the only one.\n\nFinding this game and being so absorbed by it is one of the best things that happened to me gaming-wise in a long time and the only regret I have is that I would never experience it again for the first time, no matter how clich\u00e9 it is, this is how I feel.\n\nThank you, CDPR, and \u201cNever stop

I've tried playing the game before CDPR updates it and release the DLC but i never finished it, and not because the game then was in a bad state or anything.Also this isn't a comeback story about making something bad , good. No, there was always something there. Perhaps one of the most beautiful stories of all time that deserves to be heard that was shrouded by the endless hate online. \n\nThe thing is that this games most endorsed aspects by the people are the exact same things that were always so impactful since day one. It was never about the police chases, it wasn't about the npc's with unique day cycles , a living breathing world or a sandbox RPG that was devoid of all bugs and glitches, this game was always so much more than that. It has a deeper meaning the likes of which i never seen pulled of this well in an entertainment product even outside of games, at least for me. But now it's proven that it's home to something greater and most of all it's because Cyberpunk 2077 focuses on providing what i think is the biggest lessons that we can all learn in life and maybe the most impressive and awe inspiring fantasy  and sci-fi setting to date.\n\nI just want to point out that Cyberpunk 2077 is the first ever open world game where i never fast traveled, the city, the sounds, the music blaring on the radio as you drive hundreds of miles an hour through busy streets. That's what this game is all about. There is an enormous amount of scale and wonder in every location, mega buildings stretch well into the sky , neon lights make every scene at night to burst with colors and the sounds of the city as you move from small back streets into open and strawling highways, sells the experience perfectly. Without a doubt cyberpunk has the best city put to games ever and it's not even close. It feels less like a video game level and more like a real place. There is history to every location along with a key focus on making everything in the world feel realistic and lived in. When an NPC in game calls you choom or chika or refers to their lovers as inputs it all just feels right , it feels natural to the world on offer here and makes every scene and moment that much more convincing. \n\nWhen you first step into Konpeki plaza for the big gig with Jackie for instance, looking at the staff in the hotel covered from head to toe in gold plating shows you everything you need to know. People in this world are nothing more that an asset to big corporations. Humanity and individuality is at at it's lowest point and money, power and influence is what truly matters. And that isn't obvious because it's referenced in dialog lines across the game, it's obvious because the world itself acts as if that's truly the case and every interaction you have within sells every bit of lore just as well. Is it the most alive feeling open world ever that you can make anything you want? No, definitely not, but it does succeed at its main goal of immersing you in this world so deeply. \n\nA special mention has to be given to the music in this game too. There are countless times in main inside missions alike where a song starts to pick up in the background and truly pull me into a scene and evoke such strong emotions, whether that be feeling sad or bad ass alike. There is probably a reason that every side and main mission in this game is named after songs. That's because music is an absolutely integral part of the product on offer here. \nNext time you play put on some headphones and just walk slowly around any of the downtown areas, listen to the hustle and bustle and sounds of gunshots in the distance or the birds chirping by the city square. This open world could certainly be improved in a lot of ways but it does what it needs to do most. And that's the biggest accomplishment of this game in my opinion, is just how believable the characters and world are. There aren't romances like other games where everyone wants to have sex with you the second they see you, these aren't superheroes we see in marvel movies who feel like they are spitting out one one - liner after another. These characters feel like real people and the world they live in feels like its own character all to itself, one that would carry on with or without you. Characters have their own personalities there own motives and most of all journeys that define the people they were and the person they've become. All based on small decisions you can make with how you interact with them. \nBecause of how masterfully all of these immersive elements are intertwined, you wind up getting a game that is so good not because it has the best graphics ever or the coolest world or an a-list celebrity cast acting as some of the characters, but so good because it has such a deeper meaning to it all than most games, whose biggest aim is just being fun and entertaining. \n\nWhat I'm trying to say is that this world and people in it are all imperfect in there own ways just like our real world and because of that the stories and narratives that you undergo here tackle some of the most depressing and depraved things in all of our humanity. But each with such care, and such a masterful writing that puts CDPR into a league of their own. Cyberpunk 2077 isn't GTA in the future, it isn't supposed to be a massive open sandbox where you can do anything you want and that's because i think it's something that's much better than all of that, something much more meaningful, a dive into what it means to be human, to love, to sacrifice and to lose our very souls or fight until our last breath in the service of what really matters in life. A set of character pieces that look at the most evil but also the most beautiful parts of what it means to live a life, the things that make us cry at night and the things that awake us in the morning with a fire in our souls to make things right. It's about giving us a look into a world with no happy endings but rather lessons that will last with us for a lifetime. And the single most impactful moments in this collage of so many, the ones that solidify this game as real art, are the endings. Where we can either choose to forge a path in a blaze of glory and become the living legend we always dreamed of or instead forego all of that for something even more greater, for family, friends and a purpose to something more that ourselves. This is a message that only a game like Cyberpunk can pull off and one that is more powerful than anything else this game was ever hyped to be, and now finally with Phantom Liberty we can see the final confirmation of this.", "timestamp_created": 1720605561, "timestamp_updated": 1720606204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.584905624389648438", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "168992432": {"recommendationid": "168992432", "author": {"steamid": "76561198200593901", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5747, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5747, "last_played": 1720114733}, "language": "english", "review": "This game had a lot of bugs on release but right now it's simply an incredible game. highly recommend there's not one complain i could have about it at all really except maybe how it's a little overwhelming at first with all the options you have of stuff.

In my opinion, while there's a lot of world building being done via main characters in gigs, there's a distinct lack of character building surrounding some secondary characters (yes, Panam, Judy, Kerry and the likes have pretty fleshed out glimpses into their lives at crucial moments). Take Alt, for example, she is basically the key actor in the whole Soulkiller saga, yet all we get is a story mission and that's it. Misty, while not being directly involved, is our friend and not giving her at least one side-mission where we do, Idk, something mundane, like visiting the columbarium is kinda sad. \r\n\r\nAnyway, gameplay-wise Cyberpunk 2077 is pretty solid.

I couldnt recommend this game enough to anyone that plays any kind of game. \r\n\r\n2077/10", "timestamp_created": 1719285546, "timestamp_updated": 1719285546, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "167245856": {"recommendationid": "167245856", "author": {"steamid": "76561199218914651", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 4620, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1230, "last_played": 1720499513}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a really fun game to play, and I haven't finished it yet and there is still a lot for me to do!", "timestamp_created": 1718234958, "timestamp_updated": 1718234958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "167018359": {"recommendationid": "167018359", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980176908", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 9503, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5718, "last_played": 1718743597}, "language": "english", "review": "I first played this game four years after its release, with the Phantom Liberty expansion installed. Despite the delay, I can confidently say that this is one of the best games I've ever played. Night City feels massive and alive, almost like a character itself, full of depth and detail as any of the well-developed characters in the game.\r\n\r\nThough it may look like Grand Theft Auto, this game is truly an RPG at heart. The numerous skill checks can significantly impact your experience. You can fail missions, lose the trust of your contacts, and even see some characters leave your life forever.\r\n\r\nThe characters are unforgettable, with many memorable moments from start to finish. Even the minor characters have full voice acting and detailed personalities with backstories. The level of detail in every aspect of this game is astonishing, especially when compared to other games released around the same time. It's clear that CDPR was on another level when they created Cyberpunk 2077. They knew what they wanted to make, and despite taking twice as long as expected, the final result is incredible.\r\n\r\nThere are many ways to build your character, and you won't be good at everything, which I love. Your choices carry weight, and if something doesn't go your way, well, that's life. I embrace my bad choices too.\r\n\r\nI cannot recommend this game enough. If you decide to pick it up, I highly recommend installing Phantom Liberty from the start. Unlike typical DLC, which often feels like a separate mission, Phantom Liberty is seamlessly integrated into the main storyline around the mid-point of the game. It fits perfectly and even provides extra dialogue options in the main story if completed beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe care and thought put into this game are truly impressive, making Cyberpunk 2077 a prime example of what next-gen gaming should aspire to.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are stunning, with a level of detail that brings Night City to life. With Phantom Liberty, the performance has been smooth, and I've encountered very few bugs. The world is visually captivating, with incredible lighting and reflections that add to the immersive experience.\r\n\r\nThe main story is compelling, with twists and turns that keep you engaged. The side quests are equally engaging, often providing deep character insights and additional layers to the story. Every quest feels meaningful and adds value to the overall experience.\r\n\r\nThe customization options for your character are extensive, from appearance to abilities. The gameplay is diverse, allowing for various playstyles. I went for a stealth SMG/AR build with a high focus on movement abilities and it was lots of fun!\r\n\r\nCyberpunk 2077 is an ambitious game that delivers on many fronts. Despite its rocky launch, the game has evolved into a masterpiece. If you're a fan of RPGs and immersive storytelling, this game is a must-play. The level of detail, character development, and world-building make it a standout title in the gaming landscape.", "timestamp_created": 1717943267, "timestamp_updated": 1717943267, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "165585961": {"recommendationid": "165585961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093928600", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4891, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4891, "last_played": 1689685058}, "language": "english", "review": "game. it good. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1716023318, "timestamp_updated": 1716023318, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.565217375755310059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "166102278": {"recommendationid": "166102278", "author": {"steamid": "76561199675889694", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 54, "last_played": 1716010614}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game, doesn\u2019t run great on steam deck, despite the green check.

On the other hand, I would like to recommend this game to people who don't have sex (not like me because I have a lot of sex with women, a lot) as if there were a naked woman there and she is naked. She also looks like one of my several girlfriends that I had a lot of sex with. I've had a lot of sex. I'm also very handsome and women ALWAYS want to have sex with me because I'm very muscular and handsome and very good at video games. All my girlfriends say I'm very good at sex and playing video games and being handsome. One of my lovers asked me to have sex with her but I told her I was playing a sex game and she started crying and became a lesbian and committed suicide because I didn't have sex with her.

Loads of combat options with heaps of different weapons and builds. Stealth is VERY well designed and super fun to pull off.

I'm sure that it wasn't a great experience, especially on console. But I can say, without a doubt, it's one of my biggest regrets in gaming.\r\n\r\nThis game is the most immersive, well written, heart-wrenching open world game I've ever played. After playing through the entire game, doing 99% of the side content and beating Phantom Liberty, Cyberpunk is easily a strong contender for my favorite game of all time.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be one of the few people that will see this review and read this far down, give this game a chance. The rest of the review is honestly going to be me praising everything I adored about this title.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI'd like to start in a somewhat odd place, the sound design and soundtrack. Whether it's the clean slice of a throwing knife hitting an enemies head or the brilliant \"I Really Want to Stay at Your House\" by Rosa Walton & Hallie Coggins being played at [i] just [/i] the right time - the audio in this game completely sucks you into the experience. Cruising Night City in my car, hearing the sounds of the passing market while being on the phone to a character is a level of sound cohesion I haven't seen before.\r\n\r\nWithin the realm of audio, I couldn't forgive myself if I didn't point out the voice acting. As with almost all games, the quality can vary. However, instead of sometimes being good or bad, voices in Cyberpunk go from great to unbelievably amazing. For reference, I selected the male voice for my character. Gavin Drea didn't only give V a voice, but a full range of personality. I cannot remember a single time where V's line fell flat due to the acting. Emily Woo Zeller made me care for a fictional character in a way I've never done in any game before, she deserves every single award and then some. I should also add, while the main cast did an incredible job, the background characters were just as good. The idle chatter of Tiger Claws while you sneak through one of their hideouts has both made me laugh and recoil.\r\n\r\nThe story in Cyberpunk is a deeply woven narrative with complex moral grey areas and true freedom to be the kind of character you envision for V. No matter where you go, or what you do, you always feel like you're having an impact on the overall vibe of the city, nothing feels pointless. High impact, emotional story beats are broken up by somber or relaxing moments of downtime. I distinctly remember shortly after finding out the [spoiler] horrifying torment Evelyn was put through and preceding to murder a small militia of goons to get her out, [/spoiler] I returned to my main apartment to find [spoiler] Panam waiting for me with open arms. [/spoiler] Every single story point was clearly laid out with such intent and care. As a final touch, the [spoiler] video messages given during the credits [/spoiler] were some of the best \"cherry on top\" moments I've ever experienced. It's one of the only games to have made me tear up multiple times. I could give 100 examples, but I'll leave it there for now.\r\n\r\nCombat was engaging, crunchy, fast and tailored by my own personal choices in perks & playstyle. This game rarely ever tells you how to tackle a specific piece of content, and in the few times it does, you can say \"fuck that\" and go guns blazing anyways. I played a power pistol & knife throwing maniac with a double jump and stealth camo. Cyberpunk also allows for build variety and gives you plenty of skill points to throw at whatever you feel like. Smart guns felt overpowered (in a good way), katanas felt quick and satisfying, assault rifles felt meaty and explosive. Not to mention pulling out the mantis blades for fun every now and then. By the end of the game I was almost flying through the sky, chaining air dashes, slo-mo and pistol headshots - making most enemies hit the floor before they even had time to equip a weapon.\r\n\r\nIn short, I both love and hate this game. Love because it might be the best media I've ever experienced, and hate because it provided me with something so incredible and there's a chance I'll never enjoy a game this much again.\r\n\r\n\"I Just Want The World To Know I Was Here, That I Mattered.\"", "timestamp_created": 1716902190, "timestamp_updated": 1716902190, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546827793121337891", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 274411, "total_negative": 45531, "total_reviews": 319942}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwYYanTXoosF": "Tue Aug 13 16:35:50 2024", "AoIIPwYYanWckI4F": "Tue Aug 13 16:36:22 2024"}}
