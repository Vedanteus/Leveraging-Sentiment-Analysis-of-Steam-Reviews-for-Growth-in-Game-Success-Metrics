Its always nice to get off from a long day at work and to quickly find a match going. The various modes, especially the Versus mode, still holds up. There usually always a game going on or a lobby being started. You can find a match or lobby within 10 seconds of booting up. The dopamine hit after you setup a nice insta kill with the Charger is amazing! There very few coop games like L4D2 that still hold up.\n\nBut whats not nice is the in-game \"community\" and the constant DDOS attacks on the servers that seem to happen every two months nowadays. Saw a comment the other day that said the L4D2 community is stuck in the 2009 Call of Duty online era and this is very much true. Constant instant kicks from sessions for newer players and players who make simple mistakes while in game. The use of racism is treat as the norm and if you make it known you're not ok with being a terrible Human being, you're in the wrong and will be kicked. I recommend not playing this when a small kid is in the room or at the least turn the option to see sprays off as there are many players who have sprays that feature pornographic images. And not sure when it started but since last year, the servers have been under attack for what seems like every month or so by hackers. Valve puts out patches when they can but the game is old and ripe for new hacker exploits.\n\nDespite most of my review focusing on the negative of the community, the game is still very fun to play

apocalypse and turns it into a hilarious, adrenaline-fueled, and occasionally frustrating adventure. It's like a rollercoaster ride, but instead of screaming with joy, you'll be screaming at your teammates for being idiots.\n\nThe game is set in the southern United States, where you and your team of survivors must fight your way through hordes of infected to reach safety. It's like a road trip, but instead of stopping for gas, you stop to shoot zombies in the face.\n\nThe gameplay is fast-paced and intense, with a variety of weapons at your disposal, from shotguns to chainsaws. It's like a buffet, but instead of food, you're choosing which way you want to kill zombies.\n\nThe infected are varied and terrifying, with special infected like the Witch, who will make you wish you had never been born. It's like a horror movie, but instead of hiding under the covers, you're hiding behind your teammates.\n\nThe game also features a dynamic AI director that changes the game's difficulty based on your performance. It's like a sadistic game show host, always trying to make things harder for you.\n\nBut what really sets Left 4 Dead 2 apart is its sense of humor. The game is filled with funny dialogue, quirky characters, and hilarious moments that will have you laughing out loud. It's like a comedy show, but instead of a laugh track, you have the screams of your teammates.\n\nIn conclusion, Left 4 Dead 2 is a must-play for anyone who loves zombie games, humor, and a good challenge. It's like a rollercoaster ride through a zombie apocalypse, and you'll be screaming with laughter the whole way. So grab your friends, stock up on ammo, and get ready for the most epic and hilarious zombie adventure of your life. \n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 is like a buffet of zombie apocalypse goodness, and the mods are like the extra toppings that make it even more delicious! \ud83c\udf54\ud83c\udf55\n\nFirst, let's talk about the character mods.

If I had had an XBOX 360 instead of a PS3 growing up as a kid, I would have been playing this game constantly. This game makes you feel like you're in a zombie movie, down to the little movie references and the structure of the campaigns themselves. That, along with the memorable characters, give it a unique charm that so many other games lack. This game is a blast as long as you decide to not abuse god-spots, as the game director does everything it can to ensure that you aren't too powerful. The official campaigns are well-designed and it's clear that they've been thoroughly playtested. The only way to be truly overpowered is to have teammates that you're in close coordination with. Usually, though, people are screwing around, which means that even with a full team of four, things can still be intense. This game also has an insane amount of mods. Don't like the existing scripts, models, songs, or textures? Replace them. Want more maps? There are hundreds of modded maps to choose from. This game is essentially fully customizable through the Steam workshop. Oh, and this game isn't going to take up 100+ GB of space, so that's nice. Despite the ridiculously low price, you're getting a far superior zombie game than anything that has released since. It's been over 15 years since this game came out, and nothing has been able to surpass it.\n\nI haven't touched Versus mode yet, though, so we'll see how that goes.", "timestamp_created": 1723415695, "timestamp_updated": 1723415695, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170972975": {"recommendationid": "170972975", "author": {"steamid": "76561199467469290", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 737, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 737, "last_played": 1720819058}, "language": "english", "review": "Me and my friends had a car thrown at us killing us instantly\r\ni was rammed into a swamp pond and drowned to death\r\ni was strangled and jumped by 10 men\r\nme and my friends jumped a mentally ill woman\r\nReally fun with friends\r\ni hate gasoline missions \r\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1722186948, "timestamp_updated": 1722186948, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170971803": {"recommendationid": "170971803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198198517222", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 44152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1611, "playtime_at_review": 42158, "last_played": 1723396149}, "language": "english", "review": "HappyGame\r\nChallenging\r\nTeamWorks\r\nAwesome.", "timestamp_created": 1722185817, "timestamp_updated": 1722185817, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170444662": {"recommendationid": "170444662", "author": {"steamid": "76561198928667050", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 2003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 176, "playtime_at_review": 1654, "last_played": 1723324790}, "language": "english", "review": "very goated sigma skibidi rizz", "timestamp_created": 1721612921, "timestamp_updated": 1721612921, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170440887": {"recommendationid": "170440887", "author": {"steamid": "76561199225326503", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 511, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 451, "last_played": 1721684011}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to marry Ellis Left 4 Dead.", "timestamp_created": 1721607825, "timestamp_updated": 1721607825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518518567085266113", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170125461": {"recommendationid": "170125461", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014190640", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 30776, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 30733, "last_played": 1721332738}, "language": "english", "review": "Left4Dead2 is an classic, one of the best games on Steam.

By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So I decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.

This game has won every award for its co-op gameplay. The fact that it still routinely figures among the top 50 most played games on Steam 15 years after release, despite having received very few significant updates, speaks volumes about how loved it is. This ongoing success has no doubt been facilitated by the authoring and hosting tools Valve has made available, the fact that it can be had for a few dollars during Steam sales, and that it runs on a toaster.

We 2 used to take a role each and the remaining 2 would be the AI's. And going from one location to another Killing Hoard of Zombies, Killing Boomers, Hunters, Smokers, Witches and the mighty Tanks. That would be an amazing feeling.\n\nWe would shout in our rooms Maar Use(Kill that).\n\nThe game would be more amazing if all the 4 players are operated by Humans. Always played the game in the most difficult mode. That was the best way to play the game.\n\nThe game would become more interesting when my cousins or friends used to come over. We would split the screens in my as well as my brothers Laptop into 2 for accommodating 4 players. Use mouse for 1 player and joystick for another in each laptop. We all would take each role and play the game. Those were the times when we used to assault the Witch as opposed to never startling her. Coordinating together, watching each others backs, killing hoards of zombies and moving from one safehouse to another, and of course giving medipacks to each other when in need.\n\nIts an AMAZING game
