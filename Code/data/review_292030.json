I played Witcher and Witcher 2 about 6 years ago. Witcher was decent (obviously old), and Witcher 2 was good.\n\nI finished all the quests (that I found) and the main story on \"Death March\" difficulty in 126 hours. I lost all desire to play the DLCs.\n\nHere are the things I liked about this game:\n\n - Beautiful world with gorgeous landscapes.\n - Amazing folk-style music.\n - Rich lore (though I didn't dive deep) and a few interesting quests.\n - Broad set of characters with good voice acting.\n\nThings I didn't like:\n\n - The combat system is boring and repetitive.\n - Movement is very weird and unresponsive, including horse riding.\n - I encountered multiple bugs during my playthrough, including audio/music glitches, various texture clipping/stucking, and weird ragdoll effects. Fortunately, nothing was game-breaking.\n - Gwent is an absolute filler to extend game time. Horse racing and fistfights are the same filler.\n - The difficulty is very weird. I would die from 2-3 hits until around level 10. After that point, the game became like a walk in the park (combined with the boring combat). For example, at level 20, I encountered a level 30 boss that dealt 1/5 HP damage per hit. Right after I killed this boss, I met a pack of wolves that two-shotted me.\n - The crafting system is absolutely useless. You just craft witcher gear once and upgrade it a few times during the playthrough. That's all.\n\nI tried to be as concise as possible. I treated this game harshly because everybody praises it as something you MUST play. This game is blatantly overrated. I'm not saying the game is bad\u2014it is still good\u2014but I just don't like the exaggeration about how good it is, being \"one of the best\" and that \"everyone should play it\".\n\nI really enjoyed the first 40-50 hours of the playthrough, but then it quickly went downhill after a certain point. I believe the combat and certain quest repetitiveness were the main contributors to this. The game is artificially overextended; for comparison, Witcher 2 took me ~30 hours, and I remember it as a good solid game.\n\n6.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1722179463, "timestamp_updated": 1722195813, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.563695847988128662", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171664689": {"recommendationid": "171664689", "author": {"steamid": "76561199110705411", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 35643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5979, "playtime_at_review": 35643, "last_played": 1723129990}, "language": "english", "review": "very good very nice", "timestamp_created": 1723099399, "timestamp_updated": 1723099399, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.555502712726593018", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170251158": {"recommendationid": "170251158", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118948215", "num_games_owned": 510, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2196, "last_played": 1722087917}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game.

I appreciate the work that goes into making and maintaining games especially one as beloved as this one.  The Witcher 3 didn't really engage me:  the story itself is fine, the world is large and interesting and takes place over several biospheres so its always got visual variety.  However the gameplay itself is just lacking: the combat mechanics are overly basic: the only meaningful variation to mashing your left click to attack is to use a spell of which there are only four and usually at least two of them are useless against specific types of enemy.  Ive no idea what the benefit of crafting grenades is: they never seemed to have any major effect when I tried using them; likewise the crossbow is severely under-developed: it just locks on to the nearest enemy and you can't get extra damage from headshots or critical hits etc (at least not as far as I can tell).  The environment is pretty hard to traverse in places; especially in snow-covered areas you can walk on an area that sends you slipping down to the bottom of the mountain you've just spent several minutes carefully climbing.  Likewise the horse can trip over the smallest rock yet climb a rocky hill no problem.  To be fair to the writers there is a lot of content in here but the extended dialogue choices which in a lot of cases don't change the path of the game slow the pace down a lot.  There are a lot of story lines which have needlessly complicated additional tasks added to beef them out (e.g. the interminably dull Find Dandelion strand) which would have been better if some of the more interesting side quests had been woven into the main plot to reduce the grind of the fetch and carry type main story quests.  The crafting system is by far the most complicated I've seen in a game: get a raw material, combine it with another one, craft it into something, add another thing, craft that into something else, add that to what you had before plus your existing weapon and then find a higher skill blacksmith to turn that into a nice new weapon, then add runes to decorate.  Its so dull and you need to be Rain Man to remember what components you are trying to find.\nI don't want to appear wholly negative about this : I did complete the main story but it felt like a drag to the finish. If you like this kind of long-form game (and usually I do) and really want to immerse yourself in the side quests and the monster slaying then go for it but unfortunately I won't be returning.

I wish I could go back and experience it for the first time.\n\nWriting this after just finishing Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut - the game is great: well-written story, enjoyable gameplay, and visually stunning, but it made me realize that in comparison, The Witcher 3 is still on another level\u2014a masterpiece. I've played numerous RPGs, but few come close to The Witcher 3 in terms of the overall experience, including immersion, world-building, role-playing, player choices, blend of fantasy and realism, soundtrack, and replayability. The Next-Gen update has also made the game look absolutely stunning and not at all dated. The world, especially Toussaint, is incredibly beautiful.\n\nThe combat may be the weakest part of the game and can feel slightly dated, but it's definitely playable and not as bad as some people say. My favorite aspect is preparing for combat\u2014knowing which potions or signs to use against specific types of enemies and situations.\n\nOne aspect that sets The Witcher 3 apart from other games is the developers' attention to detail, which makes the world extremely immersive and story-rich. The variety in the side quests is remarkable in terms of storytelling, often blending elements encountered elsewhere. Many of these quests are even more entertaining than the main storyline. This attention extends to random world encounters; in most other games, it's simply about killing bandits or rescuing someone, but in The Witcher 3, you can become invested in random characters you meet on the road, sympathize with their stories, investigate, and make tough decisions that leave you pondering whether you made the right choice.\n\nI also appreciate that throughout the game\u2014whether in main quests, side quests, or random encounters\u2014you have the freedom to make choices, although sometimes the wording can be misleading in certain quests. Almost every choice has impactful, sometimes far-reaching, and unexpected consequences, which enhances the world's immersion, realism, and complexity. You can play as you like, shaping Geralt as you imagine or want him to be. This freedom is something I enjoy more than RPGs where players have limited decision-making and must follow a predetermined path.\n\nIf I were to rate some of the RPGs I've enjoyed (minimum 80 hours):\n\nThe Witcher 3: 10/10\nElden Ring: 10/10\nSkyrim: 9.5/10\nKingdom Come: Deliverance: 9/10\nCyberpunk: 8.5/10\nGhost of Tsushima: 8/10\nHogwarts Legacy: 8/10\nAssassin's Creed Origins: 7.5/10\nAssassin's Creed Odyssey: 7/10", "timestamp_created": 1718730677, "timestamp_updated": 1720211567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 423, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.929780304431915283", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169430291": {"recommendationid": "169430291", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060653815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 6030, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6030, "last_played": 1720543274}, "language": "english", "review": "It's so cool that this card game comes with a free RPG side game!!!", "timestamp_created": 1720543313, "timestamp_updated": 1720543313, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 202, "votes_funny": 136, "weighted_vote_score": "0.921106636524200439", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "165489699": {"recommendationid": "165489699", "author": {"steamid": "76561199219910191", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 7360, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7336, "last_played": 1718825777}, "language": "english", "review": "\n---{ Graphics }---\n\u2610 You forget what reality is\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Don\u2018t look too long at it\n\u2610 MS-DOS\n\n---{ Gameplay }---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 It's just gameplay\n\u2610 Mehh\n\u2610 Watch paint dry instead\n\u2610 Just don't\n\n---{ Audio }---\n\u2611 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 I'm now deaf\n\n---{ Audience }---\n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Grandma\n\n---{ PC Requirements }---\n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{ Game Size }---\n\u2610 Floppy Disk\n\u2610 Old Fashioned\n\u2611 Workable\n\u2610 Big\n\u2610 Will eat 10% of your 1TB hard drive\n\u2610 You will want an entire hard drive to hold it\n\u2610 You will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data\n\n---{ Difficulty }---\n\u2610 Just press 'W'\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Significant brain usage\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{ Grind }---\n\u2610 Nothing to grind\n\u2610 Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks\n\u2611 Isn't necessary to progress\n\u2610 Average grind level\n\u2610 Too much grind\n\u2610 You'll need a second life for grinding\n\n---{ Story }---\n\u2610 No Story\n\u2610 Some lore\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Lovely\n\u2611 It'll replace your life\n\n---{ Game Time }---\n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of coffee\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2611 Long\n\u2610 To infinity and beyond\n\n---{ Price }---\n\u2610 It's free!\n\u2611 Worth the price\n\u2610 If it's on sale\n\u2610 If u have some spare money left\n\u2610 Not recommended\n\u2610 You could also just burn your money\n\n---{ Bugs }---\n\u2611 Never heard of\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 ARK: Survival Evolved\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n---{ ? / 10 }---\n\u2610 1\n\u2610 2\n\u2610 3\n\u2610 4\n\u2610 5\n\u2610 6\n\u2610 7\n\u2610 8\n\u2610 9\n\u2611 10\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1715890787, "timestamp_updated": 1715890787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 63, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.847564220428466797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "167297215": {"recommendationid": "167297215", "author": {"steamid": "76561199031756745", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 107, "playtime_forever": 8209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6291, "last_played": 1719866864}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] [b]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - A Journey from Frustration to Fascination[/b] [/h1]\n\n[b]Having never played the previous installments of The Witcher series[/b], I found myself diving into The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt with a mix of excitement and trepidation. From the outset, the game felt like a [b]deprecation. The clunky combat mechanics and awkward movement system were immediate turn-offs.[/b] The game's complexity was overwhelming, inundating me with a barrage of new characters and rapidly evolving plot threads before I had even grasped the controls or memorized the key bindings. [b]Each attempt to immerse myself ended in boredom and frustration, as I felt humiliated by my inability to fight, navigate, or make crucial decisions effectively.[/b]\n\n[b]However, as I reached the 50-hour mark, a revelation dawned on me.[/b] The game is designed to be challenging and intricate, and therein lies its allure. The initial struggle became a driving force, compelling me to persevere and master the game's systems. [b]The wooden simplicity of the controls and mechanics faded into the background as I grew accustomed to them, allowing me to focus on exploring the rich, immersive world.[/b]\n\nDelving deeper into the game, [b]I began to truly embody the role of Geralt of Rivia I felt his rage at the world, his complex relationship with Yennefer, and the weight of his quest to find Ciri.[/b] The narrative became a living, breathing experience, with each cutscene evoking genuine emotions\u2014laughter at the witty banter and sorrow at the loss of loved ones. [b]The way Geralt's actions impacted the game world was particularly satisfying, as favors granted to various characters came full circle in the end.[/b]\n\nThe soundtrack deserves special mention for its ability to heighten every moment, from the smallest skirmish to the most pivotal plot twist. The characters' loyalty and interconnectedness added depth to the story, making my choices feel significant. Despite the initial shortcomings, these aspects overshadowed the early frustrations.\n\n[b]After spending over 100 hours in the game, completing the main storyline and most side quests[/b], I can confidently say that [b]The Witcher 3's slow-paced development is a double-edged sword[/b].

In 250+ hours, all achievements conquered, all maps cleansed of their quests and points of interest, and all dlc content thoroughly explored, I can confidently say I've experienced nearly everything this game has to offer.\n\nThis was the one: CDPR's golden child.  I know i'm rather late to the party, but I finally made time to try the game I had heard such an overwhelming amount about over the last decade.  Thankfully, I was not jumping in blind as I have completed both the Witcher 1 and 2 prior to tackling this beast, and would say I enjoyed those a moderate amount.  But this--the Witcher 3--this is the one that has gained a staggeringly strong reputation over the years for being such a strong entry in the fantasy RPG genre.  Needless to say, I went in with rather high expectations.\n\nI'll keep it short and say that those expectations were absolutely met.  The absurd level of detail and effort put into creating a living, breathing world that ensures the player will [i]not[/i] feel like the center of the universe is incredibly respectable, leaving said player with an immensely satisfying and immersive experience.  One that I could not recommend more. . . . . . . .\n\n[h2]IF[/h2]\n\na primarily story driven game is what resonates with the player.  \n\nTo go on a bit of a tangent, every time there's a [i]what's a popular game that you just couldn't get into?![/i] thread on popular gaming sites or reddit, there's always 2 very common answers: Zelda, Breath of the Wild (a discussion for another day..) and the Witcher 3.  That said, despite thoroughly enjoying my time, I have [i]absolutely[/i] come to understand why so many feel they just can't get into this game.\n\nThe Witcher 3's biggest strength is that the devs knew exactly what they wanted this game to be.  The engaging story and its themes, the lively cast of characters, the beautifully detailed and immersive world?  All great stuff!  The Witcher 3 as a general experience is undeniably fantastic...\n\nThe Witcher 3 as a [i]game[/i]?... Yeeeeah there's just nothing of interest here.   The problem with the devs focusing so hard on creating a believable world is that they doubled down on finely tuning this aspect of the game, leaving the rest of the experience to suffer as a result.  The player can go [i]hours[/i] without interacting with any of the game's core mechanics if they happen to engage in a chain of story-centered quests, which doesn't necessarily have to be viewed as a bad thing, but when they do finally happen upon gameplay, it can feel under cooked.\n\nThe open world contains many memorable and varied side quests, admittedly, but contains just as many points of interest that are considered busy work in other games of a similar format.  Combat is often cited as a particularly weak part of the gameplay as it boils down to a very a simplistic dodge-and-counter loop, a complaint I can't disagree with.  There are dozens of armor/weapon sets that all differ [i]only[/i] in numerical stats until the dlc, which by then is too little too late.  Signs, this game's version of magic, are rather one-dimensional and therefore pretty limited in spicing up combat.  There are [i]hundreds[/i] of lootable items, and while not all of them add to the limit, the devs decided on keeping the weight system that plagues so many rpg's.  This isn't a survival game, so no idea why this system exists here.  The list goes on, but I feel the point across.\n\nI can wholeheartedly recommend this title [i]if[/i] and only if the player is aware of what they're getting into.

The character models aren\u2019t just well-crafted; they\u2019re so expressive you might start questioning if they\u2019re more emotionally available than your ex. And the landscapes? Oh boy, forget your last vacation photos because this game\u2019s scenery makes them look like they were taken with a potato. You\u2019ll find yourself stopping to admire the view so often that Geralt might as well get a side gig as a travel blogger.\n\n[h2]Engaging Systems and Storyline That Make Netflix Binge-Worthy[/h2]\n\nThis game isn\u2019t just a pretty face; it\u2019s got brains too. The systems, from alchemy to combat, are designed to keep you on your toes. The storyline balances the grand scale of world politics with personal conflicts so well, you might start thinking about running for office just to have something this interesting in your life. You\u2019ll be torn between chasing after your adopted daughter, Ciri, and diving into political intrigues so juicy they make House of Cards look like a high school student council meeting.\n\n[h2]Combat: Like Dancing with Swords (But Less Graceful)[/h2]\n\nCombat in The Witcher 3 is a dance, a deadly, monster-slaying dance. Geralt\u2019s swordplay is swift and fluid, and with signs and potions in the mix, you\u2019ll feel like a magical martial artist. However, gauging range in combat can be a bit like trying to swat a fly with a broomstick \u2013 sometimes you hit the mark, and sometimes you\u2019re just flailing around like you\u2019re at a rave. But when you do connect, oh, the satisfaction is real.\n\n[h2]Weather: Beautiful but Barely There[/h2]\n\nThe dynamic weather in The Witcher 3 adds an atmospheric touch that\u2019s as gorgeous as it is irrelevant. Sure, it\u2019s fun to watch a storm roll in, but it could\u2019ve done so much more. Imagine tracking a monster through a blizzard, where the wind isn\u2019t just blowing your hair but your chances of survival. Alas, the weather is more like background noise \u2013 pretty but not really making much of a difference. It\u2019s like having a sports car and only using it to drive to the grocery store. I hope it's getting obvious I'm grasping at straws here, trying to find drawbacks.\n\n[h2]An End That Leaves You Wanting More (And Sobbing Uncontrollably)[/h2]\n\nAll jokes aside, the biggest downside of The Witcher 3? It ends. After countless hours of engrossing gameplay, rich storytelling, and memorable adventures, you\u2019ll be left staring at the credits, wondering what to do with your life. The realization that your epic journey has a conclusion might have you bargaining with the gaming gods for just one more quest. But like all good things, it\u2019s the journey that matters, even if you\u2019re left with a void that only another replay can fill.\n\n[h2]Verdict[/h2]\n\n[b]Graphics: 10/10[/b]\nSo stunning, they might make you reconsider reality. Your eyes will thank you.\n\n[b]Sound: 9.5/10[/b]\nFrom epic soundtracks to immersive soundscapes, your ears are in for a treat. Just don\u2019t start singing LELELELELE along in public.\n\n[b]Gameplay: 9/10[/b]\nEngaging and fluid, with just a touch of awkward flailing. Like a first date that goes surprisingly well.\n\n[b]Story: 10/10[/b]\nAn engrossing narrative that\u2019s better than most TV shows. Get ready to binge.\n\n[b][u]Overall: 9.6/10[/u][/b]\n\n[h2]Closing Thoughts: A Journey Worth Every Step (And Every Monster Guts)[/h2]\n\nThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt isn\u2019t just a game; it\u2019s an experience that will have you hooked from the first monster hunt to the final farewell. With its stunning visuals, deep story, and fluid combat, it sets a new standard for RPGs. Whether you\u2019re a veteran witcher or a newcomer, this is one journey you\u2019ll cherish. Prepare to lose yourself in a world where every choice matters and every monster has a backstory more interesting than your co-worker\u2019s vacation slides. Just remember, the path of a witcher is tough, but oh so worth it. Get ready to dive in \u2013 just don\u2019t forget to come up for air. Or snacks.

Ever since then I never felt ashamed by my choices which always led Geralt to have some fun times with all the plowable women in the game.

Just don't expect the dynamic and fluid action from games like Elden Ring or the most recent Zelda games, as that is not the experience this game has to offer.\n\nIn terms of difficulty I believe the game is accessible to pretty much everyone, combat and some other mechanics can be bit tricky to master especially at the beginning and at higher difficulties, but the lower difficulties are there in case you just want to enjoy the story or if you aren't particularly fond of the gameplay. Also, I don't think the game is particularly grindy and you can pretty much advance the main story whenever you feel like it.\n\nAs for bugs, you might find the occasional visual bug here or there as it's common with these types of games but in all my years playing it I've never encountered anything game breaking.\n\nThe game is long and if you want to experience everything it has to offer including the DLC's you'll need a bit of free time. It's also one of those games where choices matter and sometimes you might regret the decisions you previously took. This may lead to reloading previous saves or multiple playthroughs if you're like me.\n\nSpeaking of decisions, while the game can import saves from the previous game you won't miss much if you don't do it. The game has the option to simulate the most important decisions and it's a great entry point despite being the third instalment of the series. That said, if you have the time do give the second game a try as it's also a banger and you'll get the full witcher experience. The first game, however, I cannot recommend as much and it's absolutely not for everyone. It's an older game, from a simpler time back when CDPR were still a small studio. Thankfully a remake of it is planned! Also, no decision from the first game is imported to this one, you might just not get the occasional reference.\n\nThe game also has a very active and talented modding community and CDPR even launched it's own modding tool called REDMod. If you're into that, it can be another plus.\n\nThe game is also pretty affordable and it can be found multiple times at discount throughout the year. You can easily grab the complete edition of the game for 10-12\u20ac. \n\nAnd last but not least a special shoutout to the Gwent minigame, of the best minigames ever that even led to the creation of it's own separate game (even if didn't turn out as good in the end).\n\nTLDR - simply one of the best of all time.", "timestamp_created": 1716405417, "timestamp_updated": 1716405417, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.531604111194610596", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "165862919": {"recommendationid": "165862919", "author": {"steamid": "76561199309484347", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 2836, "last_played": 1671404071}, "language": "english", "review": "Waited years to be able to play the Witcher 3.
