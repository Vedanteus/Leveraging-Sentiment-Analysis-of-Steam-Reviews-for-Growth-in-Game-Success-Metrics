Today I\u2019m diving into \"Payday 2\" on Steam, the ultimate heist simulator that\u2019s all about pulling off epic robberies with your crew. Here\u2019s my take on this action-packed game:[/b]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]Intense Heists: The adrenaline rush you get from planning and executing heists is off the charts. Whether you\u2019re cracking safes, stealing jewels, or pulling off a bank robbery, every mission feels like a blockbuster heist movie.\n\n[*]Team Coordination: Working with friends or AI teammates adds a strategic layer. Coordinating your moves and setting up ambushes feels so satisfying when it all comes together perfectly.\n\n[*]Customization Galore: From weapons to masks, \"Payday 2\" lets you customize everything. Want to look like a clown while wielding a shotgun? Go for it. The options are endless, and it\u2019s a blast to mix and match gear.\n\n[*]Replayability: Each heist offers multiple approaches, so you can replay missions to try out different strategies or go for those elusive achievements. It keeps the gameplay fresh and exciting.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n[list]\n[*]DLC Dependency: This is the big one. While the base game is fun, you\u2019ll quickly realize that a lot of the best content is locked behind DLC paywalls. New heists, characters, and weapons are often part of DLC packs, which can be frustrating if you\u2019re on a budget or just starting out.\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]\n\n[b]\"Payday 2\" is undeniably fun, especially if you\u2019re into cooperative shooters with a twist. The thrill of executing the perfect heist is unmatched, and the customization options add a personal touch. However, the DLC model can be a barrier, limiting access to some of the game\u2019s coolest features. If you\u2019re willing to invest in DLC or catch them on sale, \"Payday 2\" becomes a complete package that\u2019s well worth the money. For those sticking to the base game, there\u2019s still plenty of fun to be had, but you may find yourself craving more variety in missions and gear. Overall, \"Payday 2\" delivers where it counts: in heart-pounding heists and cooperative gameplay that keeps you coming back for more.\n\nHappy heisting, and remember, keep your masks on and your ammo stocked![/b]", "timestamp_created": 1721476525, "timestamp_updated": 1721476525, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 16, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.606801688671112061", "comment_count": 0,

Cool guns, I wish games would understand the rear side mount on AK's......thats where the scope goes, not on the handgaurd. I know there were variants without them installed. Thats per military, and most definately required it. But there are other details they got right, like the dragunov style buttstocks, traingle folders, (would love to see a romy or easy german wire folder in one of these games, I have 2...rare, but not gone.) Also the magazine angle, but one thing I noticed is they don't group them by caliber or even specify. I guess they don't see the need, as they can balance it as they see fits gameplay best.

Base Payday 2 is a quarter of a game that can only be realized through hundreds of dollars worth of DLC. You can only play DLC content if someone else hosts it but new players are hard-handicapped because of the amazing weapons, perk-decks and attachments being gatekept by DLC. It straight up makes so many builds or guns less-optimal or unviable because you haven't shelled out more money to the company. It's a disservice to both new and returning players to need to pay so much to be on the same level as others on higher difficulties like Death Sentence. I understand that people have gone out of their way to beat the highest difficulty in the game without any DLC however, people with all the DLC have far more agency and creative freedom with guns and builds compared to the same 3-4 Hacker/Crew Chief/Ex Prez builds that you can assemble without DLC.\n\nOn the specifics of DLC, I purchased what's now known as the \"Legacy Collection\" bundle for Payday 2 back in 2018 with the promise that all future content such as heists, weapons and attachments would be added in as well upon my purchase. Now returning to the game, they scrapped that promise and funneled a bunch of new content into a separate bundle that (without a sale) costs nearly 200 fucking dollars for nowhere near as much content.

Since I have decided to pause a bit, it's high time to do so.\n\nIf u ask for my honest opinion, this game is a bit sucks. U're gotta face some bugs that would put all of ur efforts down the drain. The game sometimes would crash and u can do nothing to save ur efforts. As u can see from how shitty PD3 are right now, Starbreeze is nothing but a money fraud company (I hope I can say that I was wrong someday, but I guess most heisters would agree with me right now), so it has no intention to fix all the well-known malicious bugs.\n\nWorst still, when some people from the public sucks. Sometimes, u're gotta meet some trollers who think screwing up others' efforts is a funny thing to do. When u're get familiar with this game, newbies will irritate u in unimaginable ways. \nLet me list a few that I think some heisters may ring a bell, running and getting spotted like we turned Silent Assassin on, putting keycards on the hanger cages in Border Crossing, igniting train plates with blowtorch without disabling the sensor in Lost in Transit, cutting fences in Firestarter day 1... The more irritating thing is, they would still do it even u told them not to do so.\n\nBUT why would I recommend this game? It's because of the community and the sense of achievement. I have met more gd people than bad people. I began my heister life a yr ago. I went on solo and struggled a lot with completing the heists. I can still remember how I spent two nights just trying to complete Border Crossing, but when I finally got on board, oh god, I'm smiling for that right now. When I began to play online, I met veterans who didn't care about how dumb I was. They taught me lots of things, guided me to complete the first DSOD and the last. Some of them even became my friends :) I think I would have quitted already if its a solo journey.\n\nSo, I think what makes Payday 2 addictive is the community, and u're definitely going to enjoy it after some struggles.\n\nThanks for reading my comments, stay cheeki breeki mate.", "timestamp_created": 1719953677, "timestamp_updated": 1719953677, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688061237335205078", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "165828086": {"recommendationid": "165828086", "author": {"steamid": "76561199059730180", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 9680, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 43, "playtime_at_review": 228, "last_played": 1722666249}, "language": "english", "review": "game \ud83d\udc4d", "timestamp_created": 1716343767, "timestamp_updated": 1716343767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.674775004386901855", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169733328": {"recommendationid": "169733328", "author": {"steamid": "76561199144817652", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 2490, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 239, "last_played": 1721862980}, "language": "english", "review": "Fix the community items lock, and this game would be flawless.", "timestamp_created": 1720838968, "timestamp_updated": 1720838968, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.673554360866546631", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169330947": {"recommendationid": "169330947", "author": {"steamid": "76561199386703896", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 17389, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5712, "playtime_at_review": 9898, "last_played": 1723243359}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool game as there's loads of heists to do and some really great ones in DLCs as well.

The soundtrack is a banger, the heist randomness makes it so that no two playthroughs are the same, the weapons and character building allows for you your own unique suitable playstyle, and the community for this co-op game is pretty great (save for a few rare instances, but those were more funny then horrible). The game is a bit broken but that actually ends up adding to the charm and randomness rather than destroying it. \n\nMy recommendation to new players is to buy the base game first when on sale and give it a shot. You would be looking at 10 dollars or less and while in my opinion, it is not the \"full\" experience, it gives you a great idea of what the game has to offer. The base game comes with a good amount of heists, weapons, and perk decks to access (some of which are considered to be \"meta\"), AND you can access DLC heists other people have if you don't. \n\nPlay through that, get a feel for it, and see what you think. And if you do get hooked, then I suggest you consider buying the legacy collection (on sale). That comes with basically all you need. The new heists can be accessed via multiplayer and are not needed for the easter egg ending (oh yeah, there's that too). So in essence, the legacy edition is the full game.\n\nIf you are still sceptical, or are someone who absolutely holds off on spending money until they have some idea of what they are getting into, I recommend watching RussianBadger's or Smii7y's videos on it. The former offers what the general horde shooting looks like, while the latter shows what stealth looks like.

Back then, Payday was like nothing I'd ever played before. I remember the hype I felt seeing new DLC, the enthusiasm I lent towards playing every spare moment I had - for me, Payday 2 was this amazing, perfect monolith. I had so much fun, and for a long time, that was enough. Hotline Miami, Shadow Raid, Rats... Even to this day, they hold up well and were a blast to play through again, even after all this time. I've still got plenty of fond memories, and I hoped it'd stay in my favorites forever.\n\nUnfortunately, time saw to changing that.\n\nSafes - the microtransactions in an already monetarily greedy game, and directly against the developer saying they'd never be added (do not ever forget what he said to the backlash, if you dont know, go and read some negative reviews here). The introduction of Locke (the strangest, most questionable contract broker by far. Why is this man speaking in south african slang in a british accent with no explanation as to what any of this means? His cadence is irritating, and i dont believe his character or its conveyance. If i could mute him and only him, i would do so gladly), the continuous worsening of heists and managing to fail on some of the best concepts (how did you make *raiding the white house* lackluster?? No additional loot? A tiny heist with an ending to a strange and oddly fantastical story? Its hard to swallow, and i was a long time fan), and more recently, the EOS ruining online play, the broken enemy spawning creating skulldozers on bloody four stores mayhem, and the fact that some heists are *still* unoptimized years after release. Payday 2 has some great concepts, held back constantly by things that I wish would change. But they won't.\n\nNow that the game is finished, finally complete, I can say that while I had a lot of fun - Starbreeze, formerly Overkill, has demonstrated time and time again that they won't do what they need to do, unless they can find a way to take money from you. As much as it's painful for me to say, and as much as I loved it back in the day. I cannot in good concience recommend this game. I had some good times, very good times, but this is not a studio, or a developer, that deserves your money. Save it. Find something else to ignite your passion.\n\nTry Monaco.

Released in 2013, the game has evolved significantly through numerous updates, expansions, and community content. This review explores PAYDAY 2\u2019s gameplay mechanics, cooperative elements, customization options, and overall impact on the FPS and co-op genres.\n\nGameplay:\nPAYDAY 2 offers a unique blend of intense action and strategic planning, with a strong emphasis on teamwork and coordination.\n\nHeists and Missions: Players can engage in a wide variety of heists, ranging from bank robberies and jewelry store hold-ups to drug trafficking and political corruption. Each mission can be approached differently, allowing for both stealthy and loud tactics.\n\nCooperative Play: The game shines in its cooperative mode, where up to four players work together to complete heists. Communication and coordination are crucial, as players must manage resources, cover each other, and execute plans efficiently.\n\nAI Companions: For solo players or incomplete teams, AI companions can fill in. While competent, they lack the strategic depth and versatility of human players, making co-op play the preferred experience.\n\nCustomization and Progression:\nPAYDAY 2 offers deep customization options, allowing players to tailor their characters and gear to suit their playstyle.\n\nSkill Trees: Players can develop their characters through five distinct skill trees\u2014Mastermind, Enforcer, Technician, Ghost, and Fugitive\u2014each offering unique abilities and perks that enhance various aspects of gameplay.\n\nWeapons and Mods: A vast arsenal of weapons and mods are available, enabling players to modify their loadouts for different missions. Customization extends to weapon attachments, skins, and masks, adding a personal touch to each player\u2019s character.\n\nInfamy System: For dedicated players, the Infamy system provides additional progression beyond the level cap, offering new challenges and rewards for those who choose to restart their progression for prestigious gains.\n\nGraphics and Performance:\nWhile not the most visually advanced game, PAYDAY 2 has a distinctive style that suits its gritty, urban setting.\n\nVisuals: The game\u2019s graphics are functional, providing clear and detailed environments that enhance the immersion of each heist. Character models and animations are well-designed, contributing to the overall atmosphere.\n\nPerformance: PAYDAY 2 runs smoothly on most systems, although performance can vary depending on the complexity of the heist and the number of active players. Regular updates have improved optimization and reduced bugs over time.\n\nCommunity and Support:\nThe PAYDAY 2 community is vibrant and active, contributing to the game's ongoing success and longevity.\n\nCommunity Content: The game benefits from extensive community-created content, including custom heists, mods, and cosmetics. This user-generated content adds significant replay value and variety.\n\nDeveloper Support: Overkill Software has provided consistent support and updates, introducing new content, balancing changes, and seasonal events.
