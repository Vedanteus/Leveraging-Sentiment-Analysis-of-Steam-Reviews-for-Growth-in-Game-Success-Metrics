I am a single father to my Son, who is 14 now. My son got this game for Christmas in 2021 from his uncle, so we installed it on his computer and he started playing. By the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game. This was horrible for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son, as he is always out with his friends or just watching YouTube. So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, created my character and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.", "timestamp_created": 1721372787, "timestamp_updated": 1721373856, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1490, "votes_funny": 46, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855804860591888428", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169891361": {"recommendationid": "169891361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127072671", "num_games_owned": 230, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11668, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 11488, "last_played": 1721088243}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2820\u2824\u2824\u2824\u2824\u2824\u2804\u28c0\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2860\u280a\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2811\u2822\u2884\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u280c\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u2840\u2800\u2808\u2811\u2884\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u28e4\u28ff\u2803\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2810\u28c6\u2818\u28ff\u28ff\u28e4\u28c0\u28ff\u28e6\u2800\u2800\u2811\u2844\n\u2800\u28ba\u281b\u2800\u28f4\u2800\u28f4\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2819\u2886\u2819\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2802\u2800\u2800\u2847\n\u2800\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2810\u280a\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2810\u2824\u2824\u2802\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u28b8\u28f7\u28f7\u283f\u2836\u2836\u2836\u28e4\u28c4\u2840\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28c0\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u2803\n\u2818\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u28f6\u28e6\u2846\u2800\u2800\u2808\u2819\u28b7\u28e6\u2800\u2800\u281b\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2880\u28e0\u2807\u2800\n\u2800\u2839\u28ff\u28df\u2801\u2800\u2808\u2829\u2800\u2840\u2800\u2800\u28a0\u2800\u2800\u2800\u28e4\u28e0\u28f7\u28f6\u28ff\u28f7\u28ff\u287f\u2803\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2818\u28bf\u28c0\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2890\u2800\u28c0\u28c2\u28c4\u28f4\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u280f\u2808\u28e4\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u283b\u28bf\u28f6\u28e6\u28fc\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u28fb\u28ff\u287c\u2809\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u28bf\u28bf\u28fb\u28df\u28fd\u28f3\u287d\u2813\u2801\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2808\u28bb\u28f7\u28f1\u28f6\u28f6\u283e\u287f\u281b\u280b\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2809\u2808\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800", "timestamp_created": 1721002550, "timestamp_updated": 1721002550, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 315, "votes_funny": 83, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837890744209289551", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170155275": {"recommendationid": "170155275", "author": {"steamid": "76561198986994378", "num_games_owned": 33, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8497, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8160, "last_played": 1721911879}, "language": "english", "review": "CURSE YOU BAYLE!

No other game is as challenging, fun, and addictive as this title; Miyazaki and his team have truly outdone themselves with this entry in their list of soul games. \n\n[h1]A World Awaits[/h1]\nIf you ask me if Elden Ring is a hard game, it is not, and the same applies to all Dark Souls titles as well. The best word to describe these games is \"authenticity,\" as enemies offer a challenge based on what they are. Yes, a Dragon shooting a fireball will hurt, but it is a dragon, so it has to hurt. Otherwise, it would be a joke with wings. If there is something one can learn from these games, everything matters. For example, the number of enemies is a reasonable challenge, while three or four can be a quick death.\n\nAs its heart, Elden Ring demands precision, commitment, and patience. While an enemy in the open might be easy to deal with, the same enemy in a different zone, such as a close corridor, can become a nightmare. The player has a lot of options in what they can do, from their builds, where they progress their character and watch it grow, unlike in any other game, but in how they will approach a fight or a challenge that is in their way. \n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303604272\n\nIt is a game where bosses are more on the offensive guide than previous titles. You can enter the fog gate, and they are already springing towards you. FromSoftware has outdone itself in some spectacular fights, such as Malekith, where having a berserk-inspired boss with a giant sword that can jump into the air and throw slashes at you is not only a fight that makes you tremble with excitement and fear but also a graphical show of how the team has come a long way in animations and boss design. To experience defeat and try again is the means to become an Elden lord.\n\n[h1]Soulsborne Meets Open World[/h1]\nElden Ring's shift to an open world from the secluded areas of previous installments enhances its best quality: exploration. As you traverse the vast, intimidating landscapes, the world of Elden Ring comes alive. You can feel that you're not supposed to be there, but like a mouse that sneaks into a kitchen, you push forward, discovering secrets and facing fearsome foes. This sense of adventure is at the heart of Elden Ring.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303603901\n\nThe enviroments being so varied not only visually but also in their layouts give each zone a distinct sense to it. The emotion you feel as you fight foes and the relief when you get to that next grace means that knowing where to go or not knowing where to go changes your experience with the game. Lakes with water that could drown you, giant islands with tornadoes, a volcanic manor, or ancient flooded cities are just some of what Elden Ring offers to those who dare to venture into the Lands Between.\n\n[h1]A Triumph of Worldbuilding[/h1]\nGeorge R.R. Martin's influence is evident in the game's intricate lore and complex characters. I beat just the core game, but I was distracted by side quests from other characters. That quest became compelling and a facet of the game where I enjoyed progressing them and discovering what would happen to the characters living in the Elden Ringworld. Blaidd, for example, is a cool werewolf with a compelling story, while The Witch Ranni is a fan favorite, and her quest will take you to incredibly secret zones.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3303603449\n\nThe game is also full of secrets, as I stated before, but the quantity of these secrets is so absurd that I beat the game three times by now across PS5, Series X, and now PC, and I keep finding new stuff I didn't see before. To my shame, it took me three times to realize the game has a crafting system...haha. One can play Elden Ring, beat it, and replay it, and they will have an experience that is still extraordinarily fresh and wonderful. It is a colossal success to fit so much in one game and keep the magic of what makes it special and able to last in the long term.\n\n\n[h1]Multiplayer: a Blessing and a Curse.[/h1]\nRegarding multiplayer, the game can be fun to play with friends but suffers from it a bit. Co-op can make boss fights into a joke, while invasions can sometimes be annoying when you invade someone, and they proceed to do a 1 VS 3. The core experience is to play alone and use co-op when stuck in a fight, but there is also freedom to play in any way. In a way, Elden Ring misses those fights in Dark Souls 3, where bosses were supposed to be able to take three players at the same time.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nElden Ring is a masterpiece that redefines the genre of open-world games\u2014a title where all elements of the experience are worked to perfection and have no weak spots.

Considering it's their first attempt, it's incredibly commendable, and it's led to some of the best moments I've had playing their games. \r\n\r\nThat being said, it's disappointingly formulaic and isn't particularly interactive either. A lot of the time, it serves as a large, impressive landscape to meticulously comb over so as not to miss anything meaningful, since the meaningful stuff is packed right in there alongside some of the less meaningful stuff. The intended progression path through it is also unintuitive and leads to you easily to being underpowered or overpowered.\r\n\r\nThis game really is a sequel to Dark Souls 3 more than anything. I didn't like that game much for a lot of the similar reasons I have issues with Elden Ring. With each new game they release in this style, we lose more and more of what made them so unique in the first place. Some of the most unique features and ideas of the earlier games never got the privilege of refinement. This game really is great, but in a lot of ways, it's far removed from what made me really fall in love with the originals, and that just always leaves a bad aftertaste.", "timestamp_created": 1722296574, "timestamp_updated": 1722296574, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.646662533283233643", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169970277": {"recommendationid": "169970277", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076414601", "num_games_owned": 437, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 23401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 524, "playtime_at_review": 21703, "last_played": 1723349272}, "language": "english", "review": "Every time you sit in my place,I do wanna say\uff1a\nThis world out of time. \nOld time out of mind.\nI\u2019m down to your drain.\nOh, don\u2019t leave me behind,\nwithout you I would cry.\nCause only you my babe,\nonly you can conquer time.\n\u2014\u2014by a Tarnished which one is Melina\u2019s puppy.\n\nDerived from a song named My Jinji", "timestamp_created": 1721098775, "timestamp_updated": 1721099204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634307444095611572", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170663725": {"recommendationid": "170663725", "author": {"steamid": "76561198279530359", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3726, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3282, "last_played": 1722036196}, "language": "english", "review": "This is my first \"Souls\" game and I have to say I'm in love. I'm only about 50 hours in at this point, which seems like a lot but the completion-ist in me has decided to do as many optional bosses as i can.\r\n\r\nSome things to think about if it's a new game genre for you though:\r\n\r\n\r\nOkay so, this game kinda just throws you in at the deep end, it's open world so a lot of it is exploring to find things yourself and as someone who has never played any game like this- it can be a little overwhelming. Yes, i know that the graces point you in the general direction of where the story wants you to go but still, keep this in mind starting out. \r\n\r\nThis also makes the story a little hard to follow, there's no obvious direction so to speak. You come across random items and a prompt will randomly show up in dialogue with an NPC to further their quest when a lot of the time you're not sure why. ENSHA??\r\n\r\nMy last gripe is just that the LORE in this game is a lot of reading between the lines or reading item descriptions, can be very hard to understand it otherwise. (Thank you youtube lore videos). I know this is most likely intentional and is the same in other FromSoft games but I'm just giving a perspective from someone who's never played anything like this, ever.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, I have absolutely grown to love this game, and i'm not even done. I'm just having a blast. Bosses are FUN (mostly). Weapons are sooo customisable  with Ashes/Power Stancing etc. The Armour, Spells, etc. options just make combat kinda whatever you want it to be.\r\n\r\nThis game is just beautiful and the world is amazing. Super rewarding when you finally kill that one-boss-that-one-shot-you-5-levels-ago. \r\n\r\nI think this is the most money i feel like I've gotten out of a game at this price, the content is just insane!

I think if you have a lot of time on your hands it's probably great. But if your time for video games is limited I don't think this is a good choice. I played about 20 hours, really trying to push through the tough learning curve wanting to give it a chance. But after those hours I still find myself with no idea of what the story is or what I'm doing. I find myself randomly running around on the horse past the enemies trying to find an area where I can do anything but slowly farm exp but haven't been able to yet. I still plan to try a bit more and will update this if my mind is changed but unless you're ready to sink dozens of hours into the game just to get to the point of understanding anything about it this is probably not the game for you. It's a beautiful game and the combat is cool in that you actually have to be calculated in the way you take fights, very realistic in terms of lethality but without any guidance on where you should be or what is going on it seems like you just end up running around on the horse at random and getting smoked for little to no benefit when you overcome the enemies.", "timestamp_created": 1723324184, "timestamp_updated": 1723324184, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 11, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.617285668849945068", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171411007": {"recommendationid": "171411007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101991437", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 6384, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 162, "playtime_at_review": 6295, "last_played": 1723246236}, "language": "english", "review": "[h2]CURSE YOU MALENIA!

As my first soulslike game, I had an absolute blast getting my ass kicked over and over. I think this game is absolutely worth a play, however it is not without its flaws.\n\nPros:\n\nGraphics. This game is absolutely stunning almost all of the time. It is hard to find an area in this game that doesn't look so good that you want to take a screenshot.\n\nSoundtrack. Whether your in the middle of the starting area listening to that calming violin, or hearing the bosses beginning 15 seconds of their theme for the 50th time, this game's ost slaps.\n\nCombat. I had no idea what I was missing having not played soulslike combat before. Not once have I played a game where I so consistently blamed my own skill as the player rather than the challenge presented before me. The first boss breaks you down and builds you back up, until you come out the other end a more skilled and accomplished player. No feeling compares.\n\nCons:\n\nThe framerate. Capped 60fps is a huge bummer for a modern pc port, and considering this game will have the occasional frame drop and stutter regardless of what you run it on, I can kind of see why.\n\nDiffiuculty scaling. A lot of the late game bosses and areas can feel extremely difficult if you are just following your way through the story, and it can feel limiting to have to grind certain areas or look up a new build guide in order to simply have a chance in some cases. Bosses with large AOE attacks that make melee play extremely difficult can be frustrating to go against depending on your build, especially if you are not playing with summons.\n\nNPC questlines. Having to use a piece of paper and a pen to keep track of your progress throughout a quest, or have the wiki open on your second monitor, sucks. I ran into quite a few cases where I had softlocked a quest line due to some other quest I had partially progressed and forgot about. I don't think the addition of a journal or something that keeps track of what quests you are doing would be immersion breaking, certainly not as much as having the wiki open on your second monitor.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI think anyone can find a certain amount of enjoyment out of this game. The open world nature makes it easy to take a break from your challenges and come back stronger. Even with my gripes, this game is still amazing and I can't recommend it enough. \n\n9/10", "timestamp_created": 1722788950, "timestamp_updated": 1722804419, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.610984563827514648", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171582392": {"recommendationid": "171582392", "author": {"steamid": "76561197993765590", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 14178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 223, "playtime_at_review": 14178, "last_played": 1722987627}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1722987647, "timestamp_updated": 1722987647, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.608497798442840576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171156456": {"recommendationid": "171156456", "author": {"steamid": "76561199112106829", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7226, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 326, "playtime_at_review": 6900, "last_played": 1722972337}, "language": "english", "review": "My dad said he was proud of me for beating this game.

Elden Ring is a masterpiece in many aspects: beautifully executed in terms of lore, soundtracks, environments, particle effects, cinematics and dialogues. I finished the DLC (I didn't complete everything because no Steam trophies duh) and I couldn't be more disappointed than this. The DLC costs 40 dollars, which is worth the money only for the sheer amount of things that have been implemented and added to the base game. In many aspects, with some more tuning a bit of stuff, you could have released this as a spin-off or sequel of Elden Ring for 60 dollars and nobody would have complained about it. The DLC is even more beautiful than the base game, I sincerely believe that From Software hit its peak in terms of art department. The graphics are simply stunning, the areas rich and vibrant and you could almost forget the obscene amount of unfairness and incompetence that they keep putting into the gameplay...Almost. My personal advice for such a great company: do not produce videogames, switch to graphic novels/movies/books or something that does not include complex gameplay mechanics. You cannot make a decent game gameplay-wise even if your life depends on it, exception made for your only technically well executed game, which is Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. \r\n\r\nThese are the issues of this game:\r\n1. Bosses are completely unfair, hitboxes are completely unfair, camera is completely unfair, everything is complete and utter bs in the DLC, 10 times more than the base game. A single swing of a sword passes over you by a mile and you still get hit, you touch the back of the head of a hyppopotamus and get teleported into his mouth, you press R1 in front of the staggered boss and you do not trigger the critical hit, or you hit R1 way further than you should and you get teleported into the critical hit, the particle effects of a boss move prevent you from seeing what's the boss next move, the 5th combo piece of boss triggers randomly, so you cannot plan to trade after the 4th attack;\r\n2. Everything has been designed to screw you over without any consideration about the gameplay itself: spending 10 minutes hitting the legs of a giant furnace that oneshots you just to drop a useless item, parkouring yourself on the roofs of the final legacy dungeon just to find a useless item. Why would anyone even care about exploring a map that's 95% empty, 4% filled with garbage and 1% filled with interesting stuff? I explored and got 90% of the useful stuff during the first playthrough just because I'm obsessive about leaving something behind and boy I will never do it again. Do you want to make a compelling open world game? Learn something from Zelda: BoTW, where any single corner of the map has something quick, easy and rewarding to do, instead of filling an entire area of enemies that two-shots you so you can loot an excrement (literally);\r\n3. Map expansion was incredibly linear and boring in the base game, very good job implementing a map that dives deep in the \"vertical\" dimension, just to completely screw any player over because you just couldn't make a map representation that could be remotely intuitive to navigate. Why not adding some vertical layers you could navigate in the map menu? It has already been done with Underground Map (Siofra river for example) and Normal map;\r\n4. The damage the enemies deal in the DLC is utter bs and the balance system around the scadutree fragment is the laziest solution you could ever think of: you basically have a chunk of another game stitched to the main one, with zero connection and zero continuity, except for the lore. You talk with Miquella arm and you are projected into Elden Ring 2. Separate map, separate mobs, separate balance system, separate everything: God forbid you could make everything work organically without needing to add external parameters to make things artificially harder;\r\n5. Game difficulty. Now, this is a very controversial point. I do not care if a game is complex and difficult, I care how the difficulty has been realised. Chess is an incredibly complex game but the complexity comes from the well thought design: every piece moves in a certain way and the combination of the moves is what increases the difficulty. Elden Ring is artificially inflated with unnecessary, dull defects or shenanigans just to reach a level of difficulty that satifies whoever sadist is in charge of executing the gameplay design. I wonder how the game would be without broken camera, broken hitboxes, more than 0 quality of life features (hey they added the (!) to new items, it took 10 years but they actually did something good QoL wise) and boss patterns that are not completely governed by RNG. There is a difference between a challenge and playing a rigged game, and the latter is exactly how it feels to play Elden Ring SotE, unless you rig it yourself by using Spirit Ashes and many other tools that devoid you from any challenge and allow you to appreciate Elden Ring in the only way you could: without actually playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1721084921, "timestamp_updated": 1721084921, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582867205142974854", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171247764": {"recommendationid": "171247764", "author": {"steamid": "76561199235243839", "num_games_owned": 97, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6323, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 182, "playtime_at_review": 6323, "last_played": 1722542507}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] What I like about the game.[/h1]\nIn all honesty I think the game is great... played it a year or two ago and completed it.

The boss, is large, moves constantly from one side of the arena to another. Literally, makes most of the fight require the player to [b]chase[/b] the boss rather than fight it. At a distance, the boss can also spam spell attacks. Which makes it super unpleasant to fight. \n\n[b]The Community[/b]\nI think there's an amount of players and fans who are cool, but sadly I would have to say that it's ruined because of brain-dead people who tell you what's the right type of way to play and have some sort of god-complex over a video game. Most of Dark Souls community over the years have been known for being egotistical, narcissistic and think that they are above other players because they are playing a different build or whatever. Grow up\n\n[b]Conclusion[/b]\n\nIf you can avoid the type of players above, I would recommend this game 100%.

However, for normal people who might have hard jobs or kids, there's quite enough challenge in our lives and frankly, we could use a win. This game punishes you, even when you win. At best you'll get some incremental gold star that will likely not make your playthrough any easier. You'll fight one pain in the ass fight after another and be rewarded with... almost nothing. At best you can try to piece together some of the lore of the game that's buried and fragmented so much you'll likely lose interest long before uncovering much of any of it. The core plot is, well... it's shit. The kind of crap Benioff and Weiss would write into GoT season 8. There is nothing to endear anything in this game to player, and yet the point is to fight for it? Naw man, I'm good. Again, if you're the type of person with an easy enough life that you live for a digitized struggle, then great. You'll love this game and you should buy it now. I'll still pick it up now and then if I haven't met my daily quota of screaming into the void. Nothing quite like scripted off-camera popouts and shit-tier enemy tracking to remind you there's still people that just want to see the whole world burn.", "timestamp_created": 1723441551, "timestamp_updated": 1723441551, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54884415864944458", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170654147": {"recommendationid": "170654147", "author": {"steamid": "76561198122450869", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 6547, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 580, "playtime_at_review": 5694, "last_played": 1723343993}, "language": "english", "review": "i would have killed myself long ago if not for this game", "timestamp_created": 1721850673, "timestamp_updated": 1721850673, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.548011243343353271", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170049207": {"recommendationid": "170049207", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986316142", "num_games_owned": 842, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 12004, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 676, "playtime_at_review": 5409, "last_played": 1723354273}, "language": "english", "review": "I played DS3 for over a thousand hours.

Ranni being one of them. Ranni, my queen shining under the moon, my muse. The way her feet move while she sits atop her throne. The way she rests inside of my jar of forbidden juices. I cannot bear to look at her without exploding all over the place. I want her, I need her, she needs to be mine. The length, width, and height of each of her individual toes. First, second, third, fourth, and fifth all wondrous in their own accord. My tongue yearns to understand the taste and texture of what may be awaiting on her soles. Just imagining myself bent over on the ground groveling at her... (shivers) feet. Awaiting her every command until she makes me her dog. I would fight wars for this woman, topple countries, and conquer continents for my beloved moonlight. All awhile waiting for the chance that one day I may be able to rest my eyes, my lips, my soul, on this woman's scrumptious, delectable, smooth feet. Alongside my azure muse, rests Melina, my pink haired beauty. With Ranni my Queen they shall dominate me as much as they please, stomping their feet in my face countless times a day before we finally are laid to rest as I curl up in my dog bed huddled next to their smooth smooth grippers. I imagine it almost every night before I, Funnytimeguy, rest my head. Alas, this is only a dream that a man can have, and what more is a dream than a cruel fake reality. For this is my passion, my two figures standing bright with their shining feet, glistening in the dim light of my lamp, surrounded by my snow white juices. Every time I wake, reality sinks in, only for me to realize what I cannot have.

You will die, over and over again. You will constantly feel like you are not strong enough, not agile enough, not strategic enough. But every death is a lesson, not a punishment. Now you know not to dodge to the left when the boss does that move. And next time, you'll get even closer to defeating them.

At the same time, I've struggled in the moment to understand what it is that turns me away.  Having chosen to take some time away from it, two things have occured to me.\n\nThe first is that I don't need what it offers.  I'm at a time in my life with kids, a stressful job, ageing parents and grandparents and the upsets and demands they present, that the game's core offering - challenge - getting repeatedly knocked down and asking you to do it over and again - feels like work.  Even the gameworld's undeniable beauty, its grand vistas as they open before you, its denizens - their fantastic graphical fidelity - all truly impressive and immersive - don't offset the sense that I'm clocking in to work when I fire up the game.\n\nThe second - possibly an extension of the first - is the rote flavour of the gameplay.  This is true of all games to a degree, but there's something about Elden Ring that makes me think of Guitar Hero.  It's the only game I've played that forges what feels like a nonsensical connection at first, but the way Elden Ring riffs (see what it did there?) on learning, one try at a time, what's coming next, and after many attempts you'll have developed the muscle memory to prevail and transition to the next encounter ... it feels like the kind of rote-based progression that's the hallmark of GH.\n\nThe first observation above has precluded me from going much further than scratching the game's surface.  If this experience is representative of what the design philosophy offers more deeply (I have no doubt it is), then moving onto the next title is the right thing to do.  Certainly not a game I'd recommend to anyone for whom these observations resonate.", "timestamp_created": 1723387050, "timestamp_updated": 1723387050, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny":

Despite this, I think this is a game everybody should be able to enjoy, but some might find its flaws too apparent depending on how they plan to enjoy the game.\r\n\r\nI think as a first souls game it would probably be the best choice because of how much variety it has and the open-world nature, while a bit lackluster at times, gives a lot of freedom to the player and their adventures. The difficulty is mostly dependent on how you choose to play and in reality there isn't really any encounter you can't beat without the tools the immediately available at your disposal. The addition of the ability to summon a friendly NPC (or NPCs) is great because it adds some much needed variety to this generally lonely journey without requiring actual friends. I would not buy this game if you are expecting to play through the entire game with a friend without the usage of a mod.\r\n\r\nAchievement wise it is easy to 100% and doesn't require you to engage with generally unwanted mechanics (such as PvP.) The only thing I'd look out for is the legendary gear/items that are obtained at the end of questlines as you may find yourself locked out of these past certain points in the game. In the end you'll have to run through the game two more times to obtain the other endings but this can be rushed easily in NG+.\r\n\r\nI like the port quality apart from the 60 fps cap, I think this is a good game to play with mouse and keyboard compared to other Japanese ported games (and other souls games) though it may require some heavy rebinding (I always rebind.) I have had no crashes and performance is perfect as long as you don't turn on raytracing.\r\n\r\n[h2]Longer Review[/h2]\r\nThe open world is pretty fun, I think that overall it is a good addition to the general audience of the game but personally I think it was not implemented as well as it could have. For a game that is known for fighting epic bosses a lot of them are seemingly copy pasted across the vast landscape and in some occasions you fight the exact same person twice but one is like a summoned magical version while the other is a real thing. Compared to earlier games the fact that you can just ride past enemies you don't want to fight is a major improvement because frankly I don't really care about fighting that entire camp again. The game gives you a lot of freedom to take it at your own pace and revisit things (well, unless you trigger an event that blocks out your progress to certain things forever without it ever being communicated to you beforehand.) If you treat the game as an exploration game I think you'll have a lot of fun, but it can definitely be tiring exploring literally everything, especially as a lot of places don't really have good/useful rewards.\r\n\r\nBuilding upon the issue I previously mentioned of the game locking you out of certain things, the game sucks pretty hard in regards to communicating to the player what is going on. I explored a new area ingame, started a questline in there, only to realize that by the time I cleared out that area I was locked out of it because I killed the boss of that area who was supposedly my boss (I wonder why he instantly tried to kill me.) A lot of the questlines should be done with a guide because it is immensely difficult to figure out certain things without a lot of testing, especially since the developers tried their hardest to make a lot of things as obscure as possible (i.e. a certain doll having its description changed to be more vague.) The open world nature of the game also creates issues with questlines despite there being a central hub in the game. A lot of questlines rely on you visiting quest NPCs scattered throughout the map in unclear locations which makes it very frustrating to progress without a guide.\r\n\r\nThere isn't really any substantial story either, it's just mysterious lore tidbits associated with items and dialogue but I don't think most people care about the story in a souls game (and the creator explicitly seems to prefer it this way.)\r\n\r\nThe combat is the best part and there are a lot of good additions, especially ashes of war. Spirit ashes/summons also add an extra layer to combat by letting you pick a summonable NPC or NPCs that can hopefully fill up a role such as having a tank take aggro while playing as a mage or several mob-tier support NPCs to deal with fighting multiple enemies at once. Jump attacks are pretty useful as well, you can dual wield weapons of the same type to do increased damage, breaking enemy's posture/stamina (?) is also pretty fun to do. The combat seems to be a straight upgrade to all previous entries and one of the best in the genre. While jumping itself is a new addition I find it to be pretty random at times whether it works or not in terms of i-frames, it seems some attacks have multi-hits that look jumpable but are intended to be rolled through while other times the animation (or particles) of the attack can hit your body and you don't take any damage. That being said, there are only a handful of attacks that left me confused as to why they couldn't be jumped despite looking like they could.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the bosses are kind of hit or miss depending on how you play. After a certain point they all leaned towards one archetype which is heavy hitting and forcing you to wait until their oddly long combo is over to get a few hits in before they start their next long af combo. In a way it feels like a 'flanderization' of dark souls difficulty with the developers leaning too hard into making the game \"difficult\" without realizing that its not really fun when their tricks are a bit too plain to see. Most notable being the input/animation reading where a boss will consistently react within a fraction of a second to you doing a certain action like using a healing flask instead of having more randomized/delayed attacks. Not to mention how much the developers love putting in so many delayed attacks for some reason (why does even a shrimp delay their attacks?) This ends up feeling like I'm fighting something that is clearly a program and makes it apparent that the developers put that in purely because they wanted to trip up the player. On one hand, souls fans probably wouldn't want to fight similar bosses in the newest game but on the other it is a such a waste of potential and I would have preferred more bosses that didn't lean too hard into this. Some of the bosses also feel like they belong in a different game speed-wise but at least these tend to be glass cannons (though the glass part may not be as apparent depending on your build.)\r\n\r\nFor some reason I am also finding issues that plagued the first game still present in this (their latest) entry. Camera still struggles against large enemies for some reason, lock on is a bit wonky at times, 60 fps cap, coop support is bad as usual (you can only summon people to help you in certain areas, you cannot progress through content at the same time in the same instance with a friend without a mod.) Enemy/boss attacks can go through pillars/walls but yours can't which just feels stupid when your sword gets caught on the walls but an enemy's spear goes right through it. I do not really understand why they put pillars in some boss rooms when some of their attacks go directly through them either. These may or may not annoy you, but it is a bit disappointing considering the budget. \r\n\r\nAll in all, I think that despite the glaring flaws it is fundamentally a good game that should still be pretty enjoyable for the average player regardless of previous experience to souls or soulslikes.", "timestamp_created": 1722910731, "timestamp_updated": 1722910731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538709700107574463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171308545": {"recommendationid": "171308545", "author": {"steamid": "76561198802994876", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 6418, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "playtime_at_review": 6418, "last_played": 1722527295}, "language": "english", "review": "just yes", "timestamp_created": 1722625596, "timestamp_updated": 1722625596, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538709700107574463", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170988651": {"recommendationid": "170988651", "author": {"steamid": "76561199239532329", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1010, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 229, "playtime_at_review": 529, "last_played": 1722612760}, "language": "english", "review": "I have over 8 hours in this game and still have no clue on what to do and where to go\r\n\r\n10/10 game\r\nwould recommend", "timestamp_created": 1722203720, "timestamp_updated": 1722203720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538461565971374512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169862081": {"recommendationid": "169862081", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121032870", "num_games_owned": 1045, "num_reviews": 163, "playtime_forever": 5948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5948, "last_played": 1720832377}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the Dark Souls of open world games", "timestamp_created": 1720972882, "timestamp_updated": 1720972882, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538461565971374512", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171575252": {"recommendationid": "171575252", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294286476", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 5943, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 985, "playtime_at_review": 5444, "last_played": 1723384605}, "language": "english", "review": "No, you\u2019re NOT a real souls-like player.\n\nI\u2019m so sick of all these people who think they\u2019re souls-like players.

Elden Ring\u2019s brilliance lies in what I consider to be largely impalpable cornerstones - the atmosphere, the experience, the \u201cunscripted gameplay,\u201d etc. Equally brilliant is its scale. On these fronts and in this regard, Elden Ring offers an adventure that is truly like no other. This is a seemingly bottomless game that can and will be enjoyed by the most disparate of players and playstyles for decades. Everything you have heard about it is true. Elden Ring is a massive game - The Lands Between will seem to triple in size, then triple in size, then triple in size once more, and after finishing this game you will still feel as though you have barely scratched its surface. Build variety, character aesthetics, and player agency over difficulty are at all-time highs. This world is gorgeous, and it is overflowing with hundreds if not thousands of clever secrets and little details to reward your exploration and observation.\n\nIf this is your first time playing a FromSoftware Souls-style game, I imagine you will be thoroughly astonished and impressed, your expectations having been shattered time and time again by a colossally difficult game that demands your commitment and respect, having provided them to a world you have come to know and love. If you are a Dark Souls fan, you will have felt much of this already, and in recognizing the way each game flirts with flawlessness, you may feel a desire to nitpick this title. For me, those nitpicks lie in this game\u2019s narrative and boss fights.\n\nI am fascinated by Elden Ring\u2019s lore, but I do not care for the story of the Lowly Tarnished. Elden Ring builds an exceptionally intriguing world of mythology, teeming with rewarding realizations and complex histories - but I wouldn\u2019t say that the tale of the Tarnished compelled me much at all, largely because I was unable to develop any real attachment to any of the characters, which includes my own. Your Tarnished simply covets the throne, and the routes through the story dictate what will happen to the world once you reach it. If the characters in this world fail to reach you, this story will as well. If they do reach you, that\u2019s excellent news, and you will likely care deeply about the outcome of your adventure - they just didn\u2019t reach me, the same way DSIII\u2019s characters didn\u2019t. Some players place no emphasis on story, but with what was delivered through Dark Souls\u2019 trilogy, I can\u2019t help but feel a little let down by a game that could physically encompass all three of them. I\u2019m also somewhat cynical towards Elden Ring\u2019s emphasis on marriage - I think too many players use it as an excuse to uncomfortably and excessively revere certain characters.\n\nAs for bosses, Elden Ring delivers spectacle, often void of the delicate push-and-pull, give-and-take, dance-like and rhythmic duels present in Dark Souls III. Many, but not all, of the major bosses feel too robotic to me. New players are less likely to notice or be affected by this. I would also personally say that most fights ended up lacking memorability, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a common opinion.\n\nSubjective nitpicks aside, I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Elden Ring. This is a game so large that I find it difficult to consider nearly any thoughts on it objective - I imagine that two theoretical players with exactly polar playstyles could share as few as three or four experiences, over the course of sixty plus hour playthroughs - and if those players were to have perfectly opposite perspectives, they could share as few as none. Given this, I can only offer what are purely (largely positive) opinions on the other elements of Elden Ring.\n\nI think the open world is a pleasant glimpse into an alternate universe where Dark Souls provided its players with even more agency over their experiences, but personally, I [i]only[/i] think of it as an equal alternative to what DSII and III have to offer. To its benefit - Elden Ring\u2019s approach to openness lets its \u201clevels\u201d (Raya Lucaria, Leyndell, etc.) exist entirely in isolation from one another, allowing them to breathe and receive a great deal of individualistic polish, the same way DSII\u2019s Crown expansions did - and they are positioned along a (deceptively discretionary) linear path. The space between these levels also lends itself quite well to a player determining their own difficulty - one could spend as much or as little time as they like exploring odds and ends to level up or find better gear before tackling a new major obstacle. In spite of this, I still seem to prefer a contiguous string of stages, and I think that simply comes down to personal preference - though I do question how many titles could be made in an \u201cElden Ring series\u201d before the community at large would become disillusioned with ten-ish hours of miscellany between each stage. I think this ties into complaints some have regarding Elden Ring\u2019s replayability, but I personally don\u2019t agree with the issue there - I think it can be remedied by waiting, just as replaying any other game is more fun after you\u2019ve forgotten most of it.\n\nA more common complaint about Elden Ring is that it recycles its content - this will be more apparent to you the more you have explored. I would estimate that the average player experiences some degree of interaction and disillusion with bosses or structures that reappear without any meaningful alterations, but not enough that it feels like the game\u2019s scale has been artificially enlarged, or that the player reasonably feels that it is a noteworthy detriment. Players intent on thoroughly exploring absolutely everything the game has to offer will likely take greater issue with this, but this is an exception. Similar content is dispersed throughout the world because the player is not required nor expected to seek out every corner of the landscape, only some of it. Where I do feel that Elden Ring\u2019s recycling is problematic is in its tendency to bleed into the coherence of the story, and temporarily disrupt immersion. Major bosses, who can be considered characters, should not have optional refights tucked away in sewers or on ordinary hillsides after you\u2019ve slain them.\n\nI confidently believe that Elden Ring is the best Soulsborne title to play before any others. It is the best at offering the player opportunities to alter the difficulty to their liking, and it serves as an introductory experience to the Souls series - if you like Elden Ring\u2019s gameplay, you\u2019ll almost certainly like Dark Souls\u2019. Many people are familiar with open-world-style game mechanics, making this title by far the most accessible, and to the widest audience. I also greatly appreciate Elden Ring\u2019s reintegration of many of the best parts of the Souls games - Dark Souls II\u2019s bright spots have returned in power stancing, Stonesword Keys, and the beautifully horrific creature design present all throughout the Lands Between. New features such as the trusty steed Torrent, item crafting, and the map, are welcome. FromSoftware has always favored the inclusion of expansive and polished secrets for those with the dedication to search for them, and I feel confident in saying that each major stage hides at least one entirely sidelined sprawling and extensive segment. The consistency of visually engaging character design in this title cannot be understated, and each major area delivers proudly in terms of distinctiveness, obstacle variety, and enjoyability to traverse through - I don\u2019t think there is a \u201cworst\u201d or even \u201cweak\u201d region in Elden Ring.\n\nIf you\u2019ve heard about Elden Ring online, or from your friends, or you\u2019re somehow still a skeptical Souls fan, let yourself enjoy this adventure. Not quite a magnum opus in my mind, but more than worth your time, and every bit as deserving of its still-developing legacy as has been proclaimed.", "timestamp_created": 1721190062, "timestamp_updated": 1721190062, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.535730540752410889", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170167193": {"recommendationid": "170167193", "author": {"steamid": "76561199154291202", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7264, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7172, "last_played": 1721318307}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't beat the final boss.

For me, Elden Ring is the perfect RPG that offers an amazing and expansive world to get lost in. Though it can be difficult at some points, it is difficult in a way that respects your skill as a gamer and acknowledges that you are capable of handling tough encounters. It also has multiple tools that provide you with control over how challenging an encounter might be, allowing you to ease the frustration a little bit if you desire.\r\n\r\nElden Ring's world is absolutely incredible and, in my opinion, in a league of its own. The level design, specifically in the forts, castles, and cities, is astounding. I'm now on my third playthrough, using different builds in each. I'm the type of player who tries my best to explore everything, and even still, I find myself discovering new things, big and small, with every new character.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to the next amazing thing about Elden Ring: the weapon, armor, and talisman (trinkets to buff your character) variety is absurd. There are alternate options for your alternate options. Like casting spells? It's got it. Big bonk with a big hammer? Take your pick. Spew weird yellow flame from your eyes? I don't want to put you into a frenzy, but it's got that too. I'm certain Elden Ring provides a play style you will enjoy. \r\n\r\nThe lore alone can be a bit hard to understand as Elden Ring places a lot of story lore into item descriptions, and I'll be honest, I never look at them. But don't let that fool you; Elden Ring's lore is actually deeply interesting. If the lore is important to you, I highly recommend watching VaatiVidya's Elden Ring lore playlist as you play, or at least the first video in that playlist. (Great videos!)\r\n\r\nElden Ring might bring me some frustration at times, but it also evokes feelings no other game can. The relief and joy of defeating a tough boss, the excitement of finding something I haven't discovered before\u2014it truly brings out the little kid in me sometimes, enraptured just playing a video game.", "timestamp_created": 1721215739, "timestamp_updated": 1721215739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528985500335693359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169858639": {"recommendationid": "169858639", "author": {"steamid": "76561199368400933", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 1024, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 941, "last_played": 1721032232}, "language": "english", "review": "Elden BUSTTTT \ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd75\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a\ud83e\udd2a", "timestamp_created": 1720969992, "timestamp_updated": 1720969992, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528985500335693359", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170522510": {"recommendationid": "170522510", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970204461", "num_games_owned": 905, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 39836, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2075, "playtime_at_review": 37391, "last_played": 1723515428}, "language": "english", "review": "The best game.", "timestamp_created": 1721702412, "timestamp_updated": 1721702412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528795838356018066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169849411": {"recommendationid": "169849411", "author": {"steamid": "76561198353903196", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 182, "playtime_at_review": 3766, "last_played": 1723270714}, "language": "english", "review": "Hand it over.\n\n\n\nThat thing....\n\n\n\nThe Elden Ring.", "timestamp_created": 1720962675, "timestamp_updated": 1720962675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528688490390777588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170171549": {"recommendationid": "170171549", "author": {"steamid": "76561199198028465", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 4174, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 281, "playtime_at_review": 3289, "last_played": 1723287857}, "language": "english", "review": "\ud835\udcef\ud835\udcfb\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcea\ud835\udcf4\ud835\udd02 ring", "timestamp_created": 1721316309, "timestamp_updated": 1721316309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528301894664764404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170728438": {"recommendationid": "170728438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074699167", "num_games_owned": 373, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6346, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2270, "playtime_at_review": 2859, "last_played": 1723344092}, "language": "english", "review": "Never in my life did a game push me so close to ending my own life one instant, and then the next, thinking this the best damn video game I have ever played in my life.

Now there's a question for the ages.\r\n\r\nIt's a FromSoftware title. This means, among other things, that many aspects of the game are uncompromising. It is a harsh, brutal experience. Death is punished with the loss of your currency, as it always is in their games. Failure to reclaim them before dying again sees them lost permanently (though you can always acquire more). This will happen, doubtless.\r\n\r\nThere will doubtless be situations which you will perceive as unfair. Enemies and bosses will often know to punish you for attempting to back away and heal in safety. Some can block you; some can guard-counter; a select few can parry. Some can heal themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is complex and quite deep - your statistics will be the primary factor when determining how viable a given challenge is, as will careful selection of your equipment. Sticking to a single playstyle simply will not work in this game - an enemy may be too fast to respond to with your current weapon. They might know how to dodge spells; they may even discourage the use of shields, or certain weapon types and status effects altogether. Be flexible, be adaptable.\r\n\r\nAbove all, this, like other FromSoft games, is a test of adaptability, and of mastery. Just how willing and able will you be to think of a specific plan to your problem? If you face two strong foes at once, how will you handle the situation? Simply take them both head-on, or ease the burden by putting one to sleep, or luring them behind cover? If your foe bleeds you with every strike, what is your response? Weather the storm and heal off the damage, or pursue means of preventing or mitigating the buildup?\r\n\r\nAdapt, or die, repeatedly. And sometimes you'll die after you adapt, as well - the game will test you, in many, many ways. Survivability, consistency, planning, execution, preparation.\r\n\r\nAnd that is why recommending this game is so difficult. But if you want my opinion? The Lands Between are ruthless, and so must you be - use every trick in the book if you must. Honor does not serve the dead, now does it?\r\n\r\nTest yourself, if you wish. Use this experience, this battle, this WAR, to hone and refine your skills and your senses. And just maybe you will stand before the Elden Ring and become Elden Lord.

(Besides the times I lost my runes to my own stupidity, those piss me off)\n\nTrust me it's one of the best games you'll play and it'll be a refreshing experience compared to all the crappy games that have been released in these recent years.\n\nElden Ring was my first FromSoftware game and not only did I love the genre, it became one of my favorite games of all time. Miyazaki saying that Elden Ring is not his \"ideal fantasy game\" only shows his passion as an artist always looking for more, and the next soulslike they cook will be a GOTY 100%.", "timestamp_created": 1722368602, "timestamp_updated": 1722368702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171069478": {"recommendationid": "171069478", "author": {"steamid": "76561198081779010", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 61044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1018, "playtime_at_review": 60009, "last_played": 1722977754}, "language": "english", "review": "It's OK...

Still remember cussing the hell out of the game when it won GOTY, never understood the hype.\r\n\r\nSkipping ahead a couple of years, I decided to give the game a try and I'll admit that I just wanted to finish the game just for the sake of it so I made use of some mods to help me get through the base game and the DLC. And it was an alright experience since I still didn't fully understood what the lore was, which item did what and other such basic stuff.\r\n\r\nAnyways, as soon as the game was finished with the mods, I started a fresh new game with a legit playthrough and I BEAT THE BASE GAME!! YES, MY FIRST EVER SOULS GAME! And everything was so clear and simple the second time. Understanding the basics, paying attention to the dialogues of the main characters as well as NPCs laid out so much story material that it made a very strong point in itself as to why it won GOTY. It truly deserves the praise that it gets. I hope that the DLC wins a major award whenever that happens because it is not less than a DLC of the year if not GOTY.\r\n\r\nApart from that, all souls players know how it feels to get through your first boss or even the final boss. Spending countless tries, raging, almost on the brink of breaking stuff, and the satisfaction/the taste of victory after defeating an enemy is something any other game will never be able to deliver. Also, Malenia is a pain in the ass! \r\n\r\nThis game is nothing short of an art, an experience, a masterpiece that has been carefully crafted, that cannot be topped unless it is another souls game. I bought it for full price and not one bit disappointed, every penny was worth it. Moreover, now I have 5-6 more friends who are hooked to the game and have been leaning towards this genre. xD. However, I'm still on Messmer, and lets see how the review changes once the full game is done lol. \r\n\r\nEasily one the greatest game ever made. If you can indulge with the rage, endless tries, 10 buffs only to be one hit by the boss and then after a week after defeating that boss take a sigh of relief and feel like a champion and move on to the next boss this game is and will always be the one, that too at full price. It deserves all the praise and recognition it gets.\r\n\r\nRISE TARNISHED!  \r\n\r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1723484235, "timestamp_updated": 1723484235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1,

"playtime_at_review": 2280, "last_played": 1723546028}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't think there is much to say here, so I'll add a few things.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed, FromSoftware's Magnum Opus. It is an amalgamation of the concepts laid out in Demon's Souls, Dark Souls, Dark Souls II (though we don't talk about that), Dark Souls III, Bloodborne, and Sekiro. On every turn, every detail, and every bit of frustration and satisfaction, you will see traces of all these previous games. \r\n\r\nDoes that make it the best overall Souls Game? I think it makes it the most complete, but I'm still struggling when putting it against Sekiro.\r\n\r\nYes, the presentation is absolutely a cut above, the lore and setting is simply stellar, together with the visual storytelling. Each boss is not only a showcase of what the team can do, but also the beauty and terror that each one conveys in their own way. Pair that up with what is probably THE best soundtrack ever, and you got yourself a rush of emotions, when you die, when you hit a boss, when you kill it, when you die again, and when you die again.\r\n\r\nMy biggest issue with Elden Ring probably comes from the switch to Open World. Sure, exploring feels amazing, and the map is riddled with checkpoints (points of grace), but after a while each \"curiosity\" has a chance of you finding a repeated boss with a very predictable structure, rather than netting you a really cool item or a plot-important point. It's the same story as with many open world games; they need to fill the space with content, and eventually they can't put a new boss for each dungeon.\r\n\r\nWhat about the difficulty? Well. If you've never played a Souls game, this will be your biggest challenge. If you've played Dark Souls I, II, III, then this will be familiar territory, only *some* enemies will kick your ass pretty badly. Some bigger bosses will in fact be so big, that the camera won't be able to cope with it, nor will it have proper focus points, so you will die just trying to figure out what the enemy is doing....\r\n\r\n... And this is in part the second biggest crux. Some enemies are simply too big, and the character feels too slow despite being so much smaller, which is essentially the biggest physical dichotomy ever. This reminded me of playing Shadow of the Colossus in a way; the size was immediately solved by changing the camera zoom, and the interactability changed with how the character moved within the space and the enemy.\r\n\r\nAnother game that did it better imo, was none other than Sekiro. Sure, Sekiro was much, MUCH harder, but it also gave you the tools and nearly the same speed so you could counteract and counterattack each and nearly all affronts, making the game more fair than just rolling around, despite being so difficult.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time I play through the game, first was when it came out. Now I'll try to do all bosses in the main game (including Malenia and others) and then go straight to the DLC.\r\n\r\nThe game is good, mind you, REALLY good, REALLY REALLY good, but it's a bit enfuriating that this is an iterative project that, after so many variations, it's still failing in the same aspects as before.\r\n\r\nI hope that their next release, maybe not necessarily a Souls game, manages to polish on these aspects, without just making each enemy a hit sponge that essentially requires you to build ludicrous sets like dual blade bleed only to make a fight not last half an

A nigh impossible challenge requires you to learn from mistakes to make it beatable, and the gratification of defeating a difficult enemy cannot be matched by any other type of game.\r\n+ Cosmic horror is a GOATED theme and this game embodies that, lore is super fascinating\r\n+ So many unique encounters/fights its astonishing, and extra kudos to the animators who create spectacular fights that felt unreal at times.\r\n\r\nI would like to add that some things really irk me with this game, but they are in no means a dealbreaker, and this game is 100% worth playing no matter what.\r\n\r\n- Some modern day UX and QoL principles are indeed absent. How would one know they need to speak to an NPC several times before the conversation is exhausted? I realised it by happenstance, and I missed a lot of important details in the beginning.\r\n- Getting bumped off the main story path/kill the wrong thing etc by accident, you've pretty much got to stumble randomly on to the next step if not google it, which in my opinion a game never should require. \r\n- Why do I have to reset an elevator every time I die? I'm expected to die a multitude of times after the elevator, so why force dead time on players for no reason? \r\n- A handful of fights, especially one in particular, had too much RNG going for it, make a boss impossibly hard by any means, but at least make the fight fair/consistent based on the players skill level. I won't go further into detail because spoilers.

base tive um experi\u00eancia de cerca de 70hrs, isso explorando e tentando fazer o m\u00e1ximo de coisas que conseguia. E aqui vai alguns pontos:\r\n\r\n1 - Apesar de ser um souls \u00e9 bem amig\u00e1vel, se estiver tendo alguma dificuldade \u00e9 s\u00f3 explorar e ficar mais forte. Al\u00e9m de ter as invoca\u00e7\u00f5es e coop pra te auxiliar.\r\n2 - O jogo \u00e9 imenso e cheio de conte\u00fado com qualidade, mas muitas vezes temos sub-chefes que repetem demais e fica um tanto manjado as lutas.\r\n3 - Os bosses principais, em designs est\u00e9tico todos s\u00e3o muito maneiros e marcantes. Agora nas lutas deles em si, a maioria \u00e9 muito boa. Acho que maior exemplo que posso dar \u00e9 a Elden Beast, bicho chato, ela \u00e9 t\u00e3o grande as vezes n\u00e3o da pra ver o golpe, a bossfight \u00e9 uma maratona j\u00e1 que ela vive correndo, combo de magia teleguia complica as vezes.\r\n\r\nNo mais temos level design beirando a perfei\u00e7\u00e3o, muito imersivo, muita variedade pra builds seja ela qual for.\r\n\r\n[h2] DLC [/h2]\r\n\r\n[b]\"A DLC t\u00e1 muito dif\u00edcil, Miyazaki!

It looked fun and the maps looked like there was a lot of content, and some of the character builds I had seen on Youtube were pretty nice. i had played some of the Dark Souls games. I also had played Elder Scrolls Online for 4 years until it became to much like a second job. i actually was looking for a game that I could go back to playing solo or maybe with my son in co-op.\r\n\r\nSo I got the game and it has been fun for the most part in the 220 hours I have played. I have created only one character, which I chose to play as a sorcerer so I don't have to be up close to enemies. I tried playing co-op with my son, but playing co-op limits you on what you can do and only one person gets credit for the adventure so that pretty much was a bust. Solo play has been fun and there is a lot of stuff to do. As I have leveled up, I have tried incorporating some of the build ideas from some of the builds I seen on Youtube. Well I guess they have nerfed the classes so you can't build nothing OP like in the vids I watched. No big deal, they do it to all games after they get people drawn in. i just had to do my own build. It has worked so far. the only thing I think is kind of lame is some of the boss fights are to one sided and annoying. It shouldn't take 50+ times to beat a boss, that requires you to use special weapons that are not even related to your character build. if you don't use the special weapon, you may be able to beat it or not. Almost every major boss in the game has a potential to one hit you. In my opinion they need to do a little work in this area so some of the boss fights aren't so dreadfully annoying and are more fun. The only other thing I wish was a little better, is the armor sets. The aesthetics of the sets in the base game are kind of OK and not spectacular, and why can't you upgrade them as you progress through the game. You can upgrade the weapons. I have heard there are a few better sets in the DLC. I will have to find them. \r\n\r\nAll in all it is a fun game, and I would buy it again.", "timestamp_created": 1722143061, "timestamp_updated": 1722143061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170926240": {"recommendationid": "170926240", "author": {"steamid": "76561199302593164", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 8178, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3162, "playtime_at_review": 4125, "last_played": 1723540930}, "language": "english", "review": "I am not the type of person to play souls games at all (my favourite game WAS the sims) but this is genuinely my favourite game.

A game that has devoured 300+ hours of my life and left me questioning my sanity on more occasions than I can count. FromSoftware has truly outdone themselves this time, creating a world so beautifully punishing that you can\u2019t help but keep coming back for more.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the open world. It\u2019s vast, it\u2019s stunning, and it\u2019s filled with creatures whose sole purpose in life is to end yours. Each corner of the map hides secrets, treasures, and bosses that will make you reconsider your decision to venture off the beaten path. But hey, who needs a sense of security when you have curiosity, right?\n\nThe beauty of Elden Ring, however, is that it\u2019s only as brutal as you want it to be. Unlike the relentless trials of the Dark Souls trilogy, Elden Ring offers a plethora of options for those who wish to take a more strategic approach to survival. Need a break from the agony of repeated boss fights? Go explore, level up, and gather resources until you feel ready to face the next big challenge. This flexibility in difficulty means you can tailor the game to your own preferred level of masochism, which is a refreshing twist on the usual FromSoftware formula.\n\nThe combat system in Elden Ring is like a symphony of pain. The precision, the timing, the sheer satisfaction of landing that perfect parry \u2013 it\u2019s a dance of death that makes you feel like a master one moment and a complete noob the next. And don\u2019t get me started on the bosses. These monstrosities are designed to test your patience, skill, and mental stability. Each encounter is a brutal lesson in humility, reminding you that no matter how good you think you are, there\u2019s always a bigger, meaner boss waiting to crush your spirit.\n\nBut let\u2019s not forget the lore. Oh, the lore! It\u2019s as deep and convoluted as a rabbit hole on steroids. Every item description, every NPC dialogue, every cryptic message written on the ground adds another layer to the enigmatic world of Elden Ring. It\u2019s like trying to piece together a puzzle while someone is throwing rocks at your head.\n\nIn conclusion, Elden Ring is a masterpiece of masochistic game design. It\u2019s a love letter to those who crave challenge, exploration, and the sweet, sweet taste of victory after countless defeats. If you\u2019re looking for a game that will consume your soul and spit it back out, look no further. Elden Ring is the cruel, beautiful mistress you\u2019ve been waiting for. And after 300+ hours, I find myself looking towards Sekiro, the next pinnacle of FromSoftware's sadistic brilliance, wondering if I\u2019m truly ready for the ultimate test of skill and endurance.\n\n                                                    \n", "timestamp_created": 1721907619, "timestamp_updated": 1721907619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170686987": {"recommendationid": "170686987", "author": {"steamid": "76561199097116050", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6545, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 78, "playtime_at_review": 6375, "last_played": 1723535758}, "language": "english", "review": "may chaos take the world", "timestamp_created": 1721894839, "timestamp_updated": 1721894839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170682289": {"recommendationid": "170682289", "author": {"steamid": "76561198302344599", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 11956, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1805, "playtime_at_review": 10151, "last_played": 1723292179}, "language": "english", "review": "My first Soulsborne game and I initially gave up after dying in a catacomb for an hour, but after returning with a friend in the seamless coop, this easily became one of my favourite games ever.

video game. This game is a piece of art. The sheer scale of the world and content is worth every cent. The progression and combat feel satisfying, the visuals are amazing and the exploration is well balanced with time/rewards. There is still so much stuff to do if I want to, different builds, completionist runs, pvp, just to name a few.\n\nSome encounters feel unfair at first, but figuring out solutions and effective strategies is a fun way to tackle the obstacles, and there are lots of ways the game lets you overcome these challenges. You CAN do it, and you WILL feel great doing it!\n\nI had high expectations of the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but even then they were exceeded, this is a proper expansion on the base game, the Realm of Shadow map isn't as big as the Lands Between but it feels like it has a lot more verticality to it. And still beautiful.\n\nTHE BAD: I had some performance issues with slight stutters in the beginning and in some specific areas, nothing too bothersome but still worth pointing out.\n\nThe DLC areas feel more empty in some places with a few dead ends, making exploration feel a little bit worse, but not a deal breaker, exploring was still very enjoyable in the DLC for the most part.",

Exploring the world and probably like 60% of the boss fights were really good but those other boss fights are such a downgrade compared to older FromSoft titles. Particularly the multi boss fights like Godskin Duo, the two Gargoyles, the two Crucible Knights. None of these are fun at all because the bosses are alright solo but putting them together doesn't work, they have no synergy and are just lazy. \nThen there are an unreasonable amount of bosses that run away from you and shoot projectiles that do an absurd amount of damage for some reason. Why am I spending more time chasing down the final boss that teleports like 15 seconds of running away than actually fighting it? Also the boss quality in general is a bit inconsistent. Malenia for example, is a really fun fight apart from her waterfowl attack. It's just unbalanced and really unintuitive to actually dodge.\n\nApart from all that its a very good game, would recommend!", "timestamp_created": 1721603724, "timestamp_updated": 1721603724, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170434638": {"recommendationid": "170434638", "author": {"steamid": "76561199212199815", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 3676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3676, "last_played": 1721587922}, "language": "english", "review": "After seeing all of the videos and people praising this game, I decided to buy and play Elden ring.

elden ring without them i suppose, I do recommend this game to anyone up for the challenege and I advise you play the way you want some folks have a hatred towards summons or magic since it's \"easy mode\" But ay do what you want your here to have fun i'd assume, My final rating is a solid 9.5 the gameplay is overall fun, graphics looks amazing,length is perfect (i managed 173 hours jus by 1

From their early work with titles like King's Field and Shadow Tower, to the later Soulsborne (and Sekiro) series, various aspects were taken to deliver an experience to match the precedent of the older titles.[/b] \n\nAs much praise as it should receive for the faithful connection to its roots. it still drew upon some of the (subjective) flaws as well. Some that I consider being the ambiguity of systems that someone without either a history of JRPGs or FromSoft titles would be quick to understand. Despite that, that same level of ambiguity serves as one of the games greatest strengths, as it shares with the rest of the Soulsborne series. Not to mention the addition that it creates to the truly enveloping world building it creates. The rich story, delivered through bosses, item description, cutscenes, character designs, and even architecture, creates a vivid and encapsulating experience that feels organic rather than forced.\n\nIt cannot be understated how the world draws you into its depths, with every design creating reason for intrigue, from various coloring schemes, character designs, or concepts hidden in its depths. The vastness creates the daunting feeling I first had in Dark Souls where I never knew what new intimidating yet rewarding obstacle awaited, but on a much grander scale. I could not count how many times much expectations were subverted on launch day, always expecting it to just be a little bigger than the first area, only to realize how small i truly was in this world. I learned over time that almost every crevasse had something to find, and it was rarely just empty space. There are very few games that I can say match that feeling of ascension by the time of completion, not in the same way Elden Ring does. Truly no other game, even in FromSoft's own lineup makes you feel like [spoiler]you earned the right to be a god in the way Elden Ring does.[/spoiler]\n\nThe feeling that is embedded into the player is one of the best in the series. It draws upon the dreary parts of the Souls series, yet still remain in it higher fantasy niche, where it hasn't truly faded to embers, just drawing near. The color of the game really draws onto that, even more so in the DLC. Through this, each environment you explore you can gain an understanding of the people and the history without taking descriptions, bosses, and enemies into account. Not to mention the score, it was able give the epic dueling feeling of the Dark Souls 1 & 3 (2 had a different, yet good feeling), while fitting most of the bosses to match their theme (though many fall short, and become repetitive). The best in the OST seem to wonderfully capture the feeling that the Demon Souls remake desperately wanted to achieve. Bosses like [spoiler]Fortissax and Mohg, Lord of Blood,[/spoiler] come to mind when thinking of bosses were taken to another level by their music.\n\nI believe Elden Rings greatest flaws are simply a result of its greatest strengths. The boss reskinning being one of the primary ones. While creating a world as fleshed out as they had, while also 'likely' not having the time or patience to create individual bosses for every mini-dungeon, they simply decided to reuse some boss designs. While bolstering the world in some aspects it crippled it in others. Though some are excusable [spoiler]Mohg, Morgott, Crystallians, Fallingstar Beast, and Tree Sentinels, to name a few,[/spoiler] some are rather more aggregious: [spoiler]Godskin Duo, Astel, Star of Darkness, Godefroy, Magma Wyrms, many basic enemy bosses like Hero of Zamor and Beastman of Farum Azula,[/spoiler] among many others. While hurting the game, I do not think it brings it down by much, except with a select few as they halt either progression or highly valuable items. Despite this, I do not believe it is Elden Ring's greatest weakness, that would have to be the lack of clarity for many of it's items, and mechanics. While I wholeheartedly believe you can easily stumble your way through the game without a guide or help at all, I believe the game is too large for players to be able to grasp certain mechanics or features. Things such as convoluted quest lines (despite being a staple of FromSoft, the other games were more streamlined and easy to find certain NPCs), scaling and buffing mechanics (which have far more depth than on the surface), smithing stone routing, and inadequate or inaccurate item descriptions, severely hold back the game to be an open world experience that will truly stand the test of time. Many of these I hope would be patched in or changed in the DLC, but still remained, so I assume it is all an intention design choice, which may be inline with their 'git gud' mentality. Though it has proven that when leaned into too much the unforgiving and overly harsh game leads to peoples perception changing (Dark Souls 2). Where the line should be crossed is unclear, and subjective, that just happens to be mine.\n\nDespite those negatives- which I view to be few- I believe that Elden Ring truly is one of the greatest games ever released. It is the definitive souls-like experience, even though it is not perfect, No game is. If anyone is thinking of trying the game, especially since the DLC has released, there very few games I would recommend this highly. It may be unforgiving at times. Persevere. Git gud. It's not a bad thing. Hopefully you love it as much as I do.", "timestamp_created": 1721543990, "timestamp_updated": 1721588214, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170372239": {"recommendationid": "170372239", "author": {"steamid": "76561199257334446", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 3431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 559, "playtime_at_review": 2865, "last_played": 1723075967}, "language": "english", "review": "O, you don't have the right, \nO, you don't have the right...", "timestamp_created": 1721539745, "timestamp_updated": 1721539745, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170370519": {"recommendationid": "170370519", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309191494", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 4687, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4027, "last_played": 1721624760}, "language": "english", "review": "no one will see my review so i will do 10 pushups every like this gets", "timestamp_created": 1721537537, "timestamp_updated": 1721537537, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170370196": {"recommendationid": "170370196", "author": {"steamid": "76561198867033751", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20136, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 5049, "playtime_at_review": 10525, "last_played": 1723495123}, "language": "english", "review": "So much content, visually stunning, absolutely recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1721537157, "timestamp_updated": 1721537157, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170368869": {"recommendationid": "170368869", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057438759", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 7411, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7102, "last_played": 1721559359}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1721535453, "timestamp_updated": 1721535453, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170365395": {"recommendationid": "170365395", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034293219", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 16000, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 266, "playtime_at_review": 13444, "last_played": 1723159694}, "language": "english", "review": "Love the game, now show us KB & MKB users some love.

But it is not flawless[/i]\n\n[h2]Gameplay[/h2]\n\n85% of the game is very fun and stunning. The open world is vast, there is so much to explore that you will certainly miss things and areas. The weapons, abilties and RPG aspects are awesome. With all the equipment and weapons, you can have hundreds, if not thousands of hours of fun, as you can create completely new builds. Every new run and NG+ save will feel fresh.\n\nIt is absolutely baffling how FromSoftware took Ubisofts openworld formula and did it 1000x better, while keeping it very much soulslike.\n\n[b]Disclaimer for new players like me though:[/b]\nIt takes quite some time to understand the levelgating of the game, but once you got it down, you will progress in a very satisfying way.\n\nNow lets talk about some negatives of this game.\nFirst off, towards the end (after Lyndell), you will experience the other 15% of the game, that are flatout unfun. The last areas of the game are empty, suffer from enemies that you can't targetlock properly and it feels unfinished and scrammed together. This may lead to deaths that feel unfair, as you are not fighting the enemy, but the camera of the game. \n\nTo add on top to that, FromSoftware decided to artifically boost the difficulty by either giving the bosses insane iFrames, immune-like resistance against stagger or every boss gets AOEs that are very hard to dodge.\n\nThe story is hard to understand and I wish that we have gotten a questlog of some sorts. I don't mean like having yellow dots telling you where to go, but sometimes just a textlog of what NPCs were saying to you, would go a long way in this game as some NPCs disappear and you have no idea where to continue the quest. Without doing the quests, you will be missing out on important characters that may even change your ending. My personal tip is using the Steam Overlay, opening the notes app and noting down what NPCs have talked about. This way, the chance of missing out is lower.\n\n[h2]Technicalities[/h2]\nHonestly, Elden Ring is just bad on PC. It is an unoptimized mess and there are aspects that are unhealthy for certain ultrawide monitors. Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, the game runs with 60 FPS - locked. But if that wasn't bad enough, the game is doing a cardinal sin when it comes to rendering on ultrawide monitors. What it does is, it artifically places blackbars left and right when playing on ultrawide. It [b]WILL[/b] render the content behind the blackbars anyway though! So what this means is, that the game supports ultrawide, but FromSoftware just took it away because god knows why.\n\nYou loose threefold - [i]performance, immersion and aspect ratio/FOV [/i].\n\nBlackbars like this can harm your monitor if you play for very long sessions as [b]OLED[/b] monitors can suffer due to the hard cut towards the black borders left and right. In the worst case, you might \"damage\" your panel with unevenness or it can cause sometime of burn-in. A game in 2022, respectfully 2024, shouldn't have this issue at all. \nMy personal tip to mitigate this issue as good as possible is to use the pixel-refresh feature from your monitors as intended and also try to swap to applications here and there.\n\n\nSecondly, the game struggles with its particle system. Once too many particles are shot from the enemies (poison/ rotten clouds) your frames will dip, which will throw off your timings. I have a 4090 RTX and I can not understand how a game with this visual quality suffers this much in that aspect. i lost all understanding for this situation, because FromSoftware also developed a game called ArmoredCore which does not have these problems. No fps lock, ultrawide compat, etc.\n\nWhen people went out and criticized FromSoftware for the bad optimization from the DLC, FromSoftware basically told y'all that the polling rate of your mouse is probably the culprit. Go figure FromSoft, fix your game.\n\n[b]Important[/b]\nThere are mods out there, that remove the fps lock and remove the artifical blackbars, but playing with mods means playing without anticheat. And playing without anticheat means, you won't be seeing any multiplayer features like messages, PVE coop and ofcourse PVP.

The boss design in this game was made to annoy the player, not challenge them. Every boss in the game has at least 3 AoE attacks, some of which hitting the entire arena (fuck you Hoarah Loux). One of the best ways I've seen this game described is bosses that have Sekiro like movements, and an player with dark souls speed.

As someone who likes to explore every little thing in games, ER had to offer a lot. The world is very beautiful with so much to explore. The NPCs were fun to interact with, you get to learn a lot from them. I was able to defeat every boss in the game (apart from the DLC) which took a very long time but it was definitely worth it.\n\nMy complaints about this game would be the dungeon areas, some were nice to explore but others were hell. The ones with chariots roaming the pathway were some of the worst dungeons I have explored. It was simply not fun to do at all and felt way too long at times without a guide. Another thing would be progressing the NPCs quests. It is almost impossible to do without a guide as they move to completely different areas that you most likely have already explored and wouldn't really go back to.\n\nThe soundtrack throughout the game was good and the visuals (especially The Erdtree) was astonishing to look at. The underground place was probably the most beautiful area to explore. It's a good entry into souls-like games if you've never tried them.\n\nNow I'll head off to complete the DLC.", "timestamp_created": 1721292310, "timestamp_updated": 1721292310, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170145699": {"recommendationid": "170145699", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001176013", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 9219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8533, "last_played": 1721465880}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game!

"language": "english", "review": "My love for this game knows no bounds, but my love for my loved ones... well, that's a different story.\r\n\r\nAs I delved deeper into the world of the Lands Between, I found myself neglecting my responsibilities, my relationships, and my own well-being. My family and friends would often find me holed up in my room, surrounded by empty pizza boxes and energy drink cans, with only the glow of my screen to keep me company.\r\n\r\nMy partner would try to talk to me, but I'd just nod absently, too caught up in the world of Raya Calvino and Malenia the Goddess of Rot. My friends would invite me out for movie nights or dinner, but I'd decline, opting instead to spend hours exploring the ruins of Dragonbarrow or fighting off hordes of demons in the Capital Outskirts.\r\n\r\nMy family would ask me about my day, and I'd give them a half-hearted summary of some minor quest I completed or a new skill I learned. But they could sense that something was off. They'd ask if everything was okay, and I'd just shrug it off, not wanting to admit the truth \u2013 that I was addicted to this game.\r\n\r\nI'd promise to spend quality time with them soon, but those promises would be broken time and time again. My loved ones began to feel neglected, and our relationships started to suffer. But I couldn't help myself \u2013 Elden Ring had taken over my life.\r\n\r\nI'd try to cut back on my playtime, but it was too late. The game had already consumed me. I'd find myself playing through the night, ignoring my exhaustion and hunger, just so I could see what lay beyond the next checkpoint.\r\n\r\nAnd yet... and yet... despite the guilt and shame that came with neglecting those closest to me, I couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment when I defeated a tough boss or uncovered a hidden secret. It was as if the thrill of discovery was enough to justify the harm I was causing.\r\n\r\nBut deep down, I knew I was wrong. I knew that there was more to life than just a game. And eventually, after months of neglecting my loved ones, I realized that Elden Ring wasn't worth losing them over.\r\n\r\nI made a conscious effort to balance my gaming time with my real-life responsibilities. It wasn't easy, but it was necessary. And slowly but surely, our relationships began to heal.\r\n\r\nBut even now, as I look back on those dark times, I can't help but feel a twinge of nostalgia for those endless hours spent in the Lands Between. Elden Ring may have taken over my life for a while, but it also gave me some of the most memorable experiences of my life. As I sat on my couch, surrounded by the comforts of my new life, I couldn't help but think about the game that had once consumed me. My relationships with my loved ones had improved, and I had learned to balance my gaming time with my responsibilities. But as I scrolled through social media, I saw that Elden Ring had released a new update, and my curiosity got the better of me.\r\n\r\nI downloaded the patch and dove back into the world of the Lands Between. At first, it was just a casual playthrough, but before I knew it, I was hooked again. The thrill of exploration, the rush of combat \u2013 it all came flooding back, and I found myself neglecting my loved ones once more.\r\n\r\nDays turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. My family and friends tried to reach out to me, but I was too deep in the game to notice. My living room became a mess, with pizza boxes and energy drink cans piling up around me. My chair, once a comfortable haven, had become a stained and smelly abyss.\r\n\r\nOne day, as I sat on my couch, covered in crumbs and sweat, I finally noticed that something was off. The air was thick with the stench of rotting food and... something else. As I looked around, my eyes landed on a pile of human feces in the corner of my room.

Playing Elden Ring for 200 Hours with 3 Different Runs (For the Endings). if this is not Miyazaki's best then i am afraid what he is Cooking in the back.\n\nOk so Generic Review-\n\nPros\n\n1. The open world for both Lands Between and Shadow Realm are so well developed and Beautiful that i would just sit and look at the tree for a min or 2 and start roaming again\n\n2. Weapons in Fromsoft Games are the best part. Bloodborne does fuking amazing with the Trick Weapons and in Elden Ring Ashes of War are just fantastic and to keep like a Element or Status build u just need to find a whetstone of time which is so much Convinient from Darksouls Titanite shards\n\n3. Bosses... Just a chef's kiss. Well Designed, with great Background lore, and beautiful Designs. The Bosses that i loved to fight the Most were Maliketh the Black Blade, Horrah Loux and Mogh. Enough with Base Game, DLC Bosses are just something else, Obviously they are Hard but they went hard with the Music for the bosses, especially with the Divine Beast Dancing Lion. And Rellana's music shifting to Phase 2 was \"oohh shit That's the Pontiff Stance\". and every other Bosses are great as well and obviously Bayle the Dread.\n\n4. NPCs my Favourite part of an Open World game. every npc are well fleshed out and are so greatly Likeable that damn, Fia holding me for 1st run i didn't realise i was de buffed for like atleast 20hr of my first playthrough, personally my favourite are Millicent, Alexander, Ranni and Hewg and Rodrikka and these are just base game NPCs. DLC NPCs are just diff, all are well verse Fighter and god they are super fun to talk to, there are like 3 faves in dlc atleast for me which are Igon the Drake Warrior, Bloodknight Ansbach, and Thiollier, cause they are just so well made.\n\n5. Lastly the Ash Summons, and whoever says \"you did it wrong, summons are just to make the fight easy\". I Paid Rs.4799 and i will use the amount worth of thing that is given in game and squeeze the hell out of it. Anyway summons are a good addition to you Arsenal some bosses u might need some you might not. Black Knife Tiech, Mimic Tear and Taylew the Stone Smith are just the best summons in the Game hands down.\n\nCons\n\nLiterally everything that is Malenia, Blade of Miquella or Radhan, Consort of Miquella, cause i get it they are supposed to be difficult, but holy shit do they make me wanna Jump of a clip. That also goes with Repeatable bosses which i am not even gonna talk about and then there's the lock on camera which is just an everyday Fromsoft issue.\n\nOther thing bout the Open world is that some places were just empty... Like ya i will find Enemies every min or 2 but other than massive exploration there really isnt much, same also for Shadown Realm small Northern Part and Entire Southern part only has 3 Bosses which are just spread out, which feels like all the budget went to Shadow Keep.\n\nwhat i love personally bout the game, Everything it's Peak it's Cinema, what i hate about Elden Ring, nothing much other than general emptiness in the map (dlc as well) and normal camera issue but other than that this is just the Peak of Gaming", "timestamp_created": 1721068993, "timestamp_updated": 1721068993, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169945244": {"recommendationid": "169945244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198982646579", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 1981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 479, "playtime_at_review": 323, "last_played": 1722464591}, "language": "english", "review": "goof innit\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1721068765, "timestamp_updated": 1721068765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169940539": {"recommendationid": "169940539", "author": {"steamid": "76561198147797183", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 12937, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 304, "playtime_at_review": 10622, "last_played": 1722584443}, "language": "english", "review": "Miyazaki made me love legs", "timestamp_created": 1721064085, "timestamp_updated": 1721064085, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169940248": {"recommendationid": "169940248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198306173631", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 288, "playtime_at_review": 531, "last_played": 1722373921}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1721063762, "timestamp_updated": 1721063762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169932711": {"recommendationid": "169932711", "author": {"steamid": "76561199141240826", "num_games_owned": 366, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 9139, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2612, "playtime_at_review": 5260, "last_played": 1723384985}, "language": "english", "review": "Elden Ring is literally the greatest game I\u2019ve ever played.

Eso es Elden Ring. El combate es s\u00faper fluido y cuando ganas, sientes que lo has merecido.\n\nEl mundo abierto es incre\u00edble. Siempre hay algo nuevo que encontrar: una cueva secreta, un personaje raro con una historia loca, o un arma que te har\u00e1 sentir invencible.\n\nY los gr\u00e1ficos y la m\u00fasica, \u00a1wow!

Got the same ending both times as I enjoyed it. It's difficult to start but you learn more as you go on and the game gives you lots of ways to make it easier on yourself, for a souls game I think this is one of the most accessible. As someone who was bored by all three Dark souls, I enjoyed this one enough to put 150 hours on PS5 and 50 hours on PC beating it, and will likely do more playthroughs and the DLC in the future. The lore is great, and makes me wish for an official novelization of it, as there are so many small details that you will miss on a single playthrough, and the story is great, but not really delved into much, like with most souls like games its there for you to infer, not outright be told, which I think is nicely done, but the story is so good I want to know more and all I can, which you have to go through every nook and cranny to get it all, and multiple playthroughs. The best part of about this souls game, is if you're stuck on a boss, its open world, just go somewhere else and come back later.\n\n\nEdit Update: Beat all of the achievments and the DLC. Really worth it, the DLC is great too after you beat the main game. It can wait til you get done with it, or you can buy them both at the same time if bundled cheaper together.

that could perhaps have been indeed one of the best in decades. Regardless of wether or not it wins such award and any other awards whatsoever.\nBefore reading further, for those that don't pay attention to such a detail, I've a litle over 780 hours into it, meanning I've really wanred to like this game.\n\n  But even though it can be fun, devs., shareholders, etc. found a way it seems, just as other companies have been doing in order to sell more stuff to customers, earning more with yhis sort of stuff that should already be in the game (or at least games used to when developers clearly aimed to acomplish a good job).\nAnd in order to accoplish such a thing they turn the game into something worse, meanning not as good as we are used to think it is or would be.\n  That's why we can already buy a book, in fact: the geme's official guide...\nIn the case of this game, because they decided to make it in a way that makes it impossible for players to track the NPCs quests.\n\n  As usuall this game's company usually makes its games in a way the story is hard to find the clues, and once found the information is quite too kriptic and vage for it to be easily understood for most people , unless of course you do what can obviously they expect us too, which is to find the answers on the internet, through streamers and whichever source of information can be found, meanning that you'll bump into spoilers, whether from the its thumbnails and titles (usually are enough), and any other way to find the information needed, information of which, as mentioned before is expected to be fiound in the game, like any game.\n  Sadly for me I bought it at full price a few days after launch, I trusted the company whould improve such issues, but on the contrary. It seems, as it also seems to be the tendency of the gaming industry as a whole.\n  So, since I've enjoyed it a little while I was under the illusion there would be something of an explanation, and in due and proper time to be fully enjoyable, meanning not by the end of the game.\n  \n  This game seems to fail, like clearly, to remember we customers (aka players), have others things to do in our lives then playing games through the entire day. Do devs forgot that customers are in it's huge majority not youtubers. Maybe fame and success got into them.\n\n  So, I'll do my best to be consistent and say that I can only recommend this game for half it's price. Since I've purchased for a RPG that only gives us half the experience of which this sort o game aims to, comlpetely failing when it comes to the story's availability to deliver its neanning and undertanding unless we buy their guide, watch streamers, etc. (again, not spoiler free at all).\n  So, for some or many I guess I could recommend the game for up tp half its price. As for me I'm not buying anymore stuff related to it, and most likely no other title of games and DLCs of its alike.", "timestamp_created": 1722809607, "timestamp_updated": 1722809607, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523622035980224609", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169890680": {"recommendationid": "169890680", "author": {"steamid": "76561198010209966", "num_games_owned": 142, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1074, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1074, "last_played": 1721000383}, "language": "english", "review": "I just do not understand the craze about this game.\r\nWith the current hype around the DLC I gave this game another try (the third one in two years) but it still does not hook me at all.\r\nThere is just so many things I simply dislike;\r\n\r\nTechnical problems: \r\nIt is one of the biggest games of the decade but it does not allow 60+ fps? It has no ultrawide support? Also playing on keyboard and mouse instantly makes you feel like a second class citizen to the developer.\r\n\r\nGraphics: \r\nIt certainly does have have a unique art design but the world itself, especially the areas at the beginning, are a mixture of grey, mudlike foggy dirt. I got a 4080 and most settings on max but personally I think the outside areas and textures look horrible.\r\n\r\nStory:\r\nI know Souls players don't care about that but I do. Yes, it does have a rich \"lore\" but you need to actively look for this lore and on a first playthrough you will miss basically 90% of it. Only if you go through wikis or find third party sources online but guess what, I do like story-driven games, especially in an open world setting. It gives me motivation and drives me forward. I simply didn't feel like going further into the wilderness in Elden Ring because why ? My character has no motivation to do so.\r\nYou do find NPCs from time to time but they simply stand around and usually just say very cryptic things. It just doesn't feel like a immersive world to me. \r\n\r\nCombat:\r\nJust my opinion on it and I know this will trigger most people but I do not like this roll-style combat. Other similiar games are much more \"reaction\" based and less on learning patterns. Getting good in this game simply means you spend a lot of time on learning boss patterns rather then actually reacting to something on, well, reaction. In similiar games I love being able to parry hits but parrying in Elden Ring (and Souls game in general after DS1) has been nerfed to the ground because of PvP... So a PvP aspect is actively making me dislike my singleplayer experience, great job. You have freaking startup frames on a PARRY and the most fun thing is; Different items have different startup frames, how stupid is that? Parrying on reaction isnt possible and they actively do now want you to do it, so instead you either jump or roll around like a moron to dodge attacks the size of trucks because of \"i-frames\" it feels so stupid.\r\nTalking about truck size hits; Personally fighting humongous sized bosses or monsters have always felt bad in basically any game I have played. There are monsters that don't even fit your screen with hitboxes the size of a canyon. Again, personal opinion, but I rather fight similiar sized enemies in a fast paced duel setting like Sekiro instead of \"rolling\" into a gigantic smash that should smudge your character... but ofc it doesn't because you have i-frames *facepalm.\r\n\r\nI liked Dark Souls 1 back in the day and I still think that a metroid-vania level setting fits this kind of genre much better than a huge open world

Well, other than the fact that it's an imperfect and flawed masterpiece of course. I love Souls games and Souls-likes so I'll keep this review short and sweet, but everything that people say about Elden Ring, at least for the base game, is absolutely to be believed. There's so much to do, so much to explore, so much cool stuff to find and it really captures that incredible feeling of adventuring through a war-torn but whimsical fantasy world that fully invites the player to brave the perils and dangers.\n\nThe combat is obviously very much Souls, and while it's always quite simple compared to the majority of most action games, it's always one of my favourite combat systems as far as RPGs go. There's so many weapons and shields of many different types, so many cool armour sets, so many fun spells and incantations and a ton of really cool strategies and builds to form the combat into something you can really enjoy and master - so long as you don't mind pressing the roll button half of the time if you're not using a shield. \n\nHowever I do have my issues with the game; the camera can be very wonky and unwieldy at times, some bosses can be extremely difficult to punish, a multitude have enemies have crazy fast multi-hit combos that can be a nightmare to deal with even with well-known strats that most deem reliable. It's an incredibly challenging game and I love the learning process as I find cool and interesting ways to tackle problems, but some enemies and bosses can be a bit too much and sometimes nullify certain builds more often than I'd like.\n\nLuckily the issues only really crop up in the late/end game content, and is still a very enjoyable ride if you don't mind taking several hours learning a boss, engaging in co-op or using summons like the fan favourite Mimic Tear to help out.\n\nAlso the modding community also deserves a ton of praise, as plenty of dedicated fans have crafted a bunch of really cool, unique and interesting mods that effect gameplay, visuals, difficulty and more, so there's a ton of highly replayable game here that many different people can enjoy for hundreds or even thousands of hours.\n\nIf you haven't played Elden Ring yet then please do, you won't regret it.", "timestamp_created": 1721177170, "timestamp_updated": 1721177170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169953760": {"recommendationid": "169953760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268423702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20388, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1096, "playtime_at_review": 17270, "last_played": 1723430454}, "language": "english", "review": "if i devote enough faith and strength, i can kill a god to take it's place #Bonk", "timestamp_created": 1721077408, "timestamp_updated": 1721077408, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522058844566345215", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171939739": {"recommendationid": "171939739", "author": {"steamid": "76561199156577159", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2461, "playtime_at_review": 10320, "last_played": 1723516872}, "language": "english", "review": "The GOAT", "timestamp_created": 1723433464, "timestamp_updated": 1723433464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.521801590919494629", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170518051": {"recommendationid": "170518051", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271073710", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 1334, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 51, "playtime_at_review": 1246, "last_played": 1722578049}, "language": "english", "review": "It would take a handful of developers two weeks to set up clean ultrawide support, allow higher framerates, and rework the controls for keyboard and mouse. \n\nI shouldn't have to download a bunch of mods and clients and write a custom PowerShell launcher script just to properly configure the keybinds, make the camera behave itself, and play on my entire monitor.

Martin\u2019s narrative sagacity culminates in a virtual cosmos of phantasmagorical grandeur. Each pixelated crevice and every diaphanous tendril of mist conspires to ensnare the senses in an intoxicating symphony of visual splendor and atmospheric gravitas.\n\nLo, the combat mechanics, a veritable ballet of parries and ripostes, require a dexterity and acumen hitherto reserved for the annals of legendary swordsmen. The denizens of this eldritch realm, formidable and grotesque in their design, stand as testament to the devs' diabolical ingenuity. One might find oneself embroiled in battle against a behemoth of such gargantuan proportions, it could only be rivaled by the ego of a particularly self-satisfied peacock.\n\nYet, amidst this maelstrom of martial prowess, there exists a narrative tapestry so rich, so densely woven, that to merely glimpse its surface is to flirt with the precipice of existential enlightenment. The lore, buried beneath layers of cryptic dialogue and esoteric item descriptions, beckons the erudite and the inquisitive to delve deeper, to unearth the profound truths hidden therein. It is a saga that unfurls with the grace of a thousand-year-old bonsai tree, each twist and turn a revelation, each denouement a riddle wrapped in an enigma, sprinkled with a dash of vexing ambiguity.\n\nAnd let us not neglect the auditory banquet that accompanies this visual and interactive feast. The orchestral score, an aural odyssey of sweeping crescendos and melancholic refrains, imbues each moment with an emotional resonance that transcends the mere auditory and touches upon the very soul.\n\nIn conclusion, Elden Ring is not merely a game; it is an odyssey, a veritable sojourn into the very heart of what it means to be human, to struggle, to triumph, and to occasionally get absolutely obliterated by a colossal foe wielding a sword the size of a small cottage. It is an experience that demands to be savored, pondered, and ultimately, conquered. Engage with it, dear gamer, with the fervor of a scholar unearthing the Rosetta Stone, and you shall emerge enriched, enlightened, and ever so slightly exasperated.\n\nPerchance I have waxed loquacious, but such is the peril when confronted with a masterpiece of such monumental proportions.\n\nIn summary - It's good.", "timestamp_created": 1722477642, "timestamp_updated": 1722820426, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171151589": {"recommendationid": "171151589", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019322283", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 175, "playtime_forever": 56, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "playtime_at_review": 56, "last_played": 1722371060}, "language": "english", "review": "In playing the small amount that I did the quality of design is obvious.

It's absurd just how much build variety exists within this game. You might be afraid of being unable to use half the stuff you pick up but that isn't the case as you can respec your character after about 5-50 hours, depending on how you traverse The Lands Between. Being very thorough with that myself, I was occasionally disappointed by the amount of reskins you face in catacombs, mines, etc. On the other hand, I literally can't think of a single bug that plagues the game, even to the slightest degree. Elden Ring has been playtested exceptionally well. It's known for having tough bosses, and, most of the time, the difficulty doesn't stem from unfair shenanigans. If you feel like it does, or you simply don't enjoy a fight, you can use a Spirit Ash. Spirit Ashes are reusable summoning items that trivialise most bosses. Due to that, the game is also more accessible than, let's say, the original Dark Souls. And it doesn't take anything away from you if you don't want an easy mode.\n\nI can't really judge PvP as I've only done a bit of it. It seems like it could be fun. But it also seems as if the buff meta could become rather tedious.\n\nI've come back to the game two years after its release to create a new character, beat the game once more and conquer the newly released DLC. It has a separate leveling system which ensures you aren't way overleveled or underleveled. Unfortunately, it wasn't optimised well at first. I believe that many negative reviews for the DLC have to do with just that. When I started playing, a patch that fixed the problems with that separate leveling system had already been put out. Personally, I very much recommend the DLC too. But considering that it doesn't impact the base game in any way and that it is designed to be post-game content, you should definitely buy the base game first and only make the decision about whether or not to buy the DLC after beating the final boss of the base game.", "timestamp_created": 1722124552, "timestamp_updated": 1722124552, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170902279": {"recommendationid": "170902279", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067403276", "num_games_owned": 321, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 543, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 28, "playtime_at_review": 459, "last_played": 1722417736}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game!", "timestamp_created": 1722104490, "timestamp_updated": 1722104490, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170871033": {"recommendationid": "170871033", "author": {"steamid": "76561198872035057", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 9209, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 614, "playtime_at_review": 8594, "last_played": 1723131885}, "language": "english", "review": "mist or, beast", "timestamp_created": 1722074473, "timestamp_updated": 1722074473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170843917": {"recommendationid": "170843917", "author": {"steamid": "76561199242306802", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4140, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2810, "playtime_at_review": 1330, "last_played": 1723501561}, "language": "english", "review": ";)", "timestamp_created": 1722042504, "timestamp_updated": 1722042504, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170843860": {"recommendationid": "170843860", "author": {"steamid": "76561199138702975", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 18311, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 860, "playtime_at_review": 16711, "last_played": 1723401140}, "language": "english", "review": "i get up from the grace.

The world and scenery is extremely beautiful and enjoyable to explore for the most part, but due to the sheer size of the game, it makes some parts of the game lack. repetitive dungeons and too many copy paste, filler bosses\n\nAnother problem is the game punishes you for exploring the world thoroughly. I liked fighting every dungeon and boss I came across, not farming for any runes, and I naturally became overleveled for some areas because of that.\nThe entire mid game: caelid, atlus, mt gelmir, the capital, and all of the underground is pretty much the same level of difficulty, so it's easy to become over leveled for some of those areas. The difficulty scaling picks back up again towards the end of the game when things become more linear.\n\nInventory ui is also pretty bad. Its hard to look through like a hundred items in your inventory to find what you're looking for. A search feature or more ways to sort it would be better.\nCrafting was also pretty useless for most scenarios for me. Because they are a one time use, in fear I'll waste them, i opted to not using it at all\n\nOther than that, a completely flawless, amazing game. Nothing I can say that already hasn't been said. This is one of my favorite gaming experiences in a while, just a little dragged out.\nThis was my first fromsoft game, I don't think the game is as hard as people make it out to be.

I\u2019m getting older, and I barely have time for gaming these days but this is just one game that I\u2019ll always come back to. It\u2019s beautiful, the gameplay is spectacular, and there\u2019s almost so much to discover. It\u2019s difficult sure and there will be times you\u2019ll bang your head against the wall, but every problem has a solution and the game will forge you into a master of its mechanics\u2014 or teach you how to cleverly get around obstacles otherwise. Either way, this game and all other FromSoft games basically are created to give you that sense of \u201cI did it!\u201d Which you can only attain after realizing you can\u2019t do it at first. \n\nThe lore is mistifying yet alluring and engaging if you want to dive deep, bu ever intrusive so if you don\u2019t care for it, it doesn\u2019t shove it down your throat. (I\u2019m fact you have to go out your way to learn about it by reading item descriptions.) I personally love lore and theory crafting, and the environment and the subtle story telling here covers so many concepts of cosmicism and philosophy that you can\u2019t help but want to learn about if those interest you in the slightest. \n\nExploration is wonderful and if you can play your first time blind, you\u2019ll never forget it. There\u2019s tons of things you\u2019ll miss or mess up (like me), sure; but that organic feeling of wonder will linger in your mind whenever you\u2019re away from the game. And after your initial run there\u2019s New Game+ where you can truly go for everything you might have missed and attempt different builds and play styles. You get your money\u2019s worth in playtime. \n\nAll in all, in terms of value you can\u2019t do much better than this. It is a shining example of a video game in its purest form and pushed to excellence. Doesn\u2019t have its issues? Sure. Sometimes the controls can be wonky, sometimes the bosses can repeat or be overturned or filled with too much visual noise that complicates things. The questlines are vague and there are so many things needed in them that one would seldom ever figure out on their own. The fact that you can\u2019t achieve 60fps or more unless you go offline and mod the game is also a bit of a disappointment. (Especially since the messages you get from other players in your world is a devastating loss if you go offline, they are helpful, many are funny, some outright lies, but when you see the message on the ground you just can\u2019t help but wonder what another player decides to say at that particular spot and moment in time in their playthrough.)\n\n\nHowever the pros of this game far outweigh the cons and if you can just stick with it, it will only enamor you with its world and gameplay.  I could talk on and on about it but at the end of the day it\u2019s just worth it every penny. You get tons of hours of gameplay and entertainment from this game.

I feel like within those timespans, all enemies are perfectly balanced and fun to fight against with even the small enemies is fun to fight with. caves unfortunately are the worst parts of the game theyre great early on since theyre unique but as more caves go on it would just be variations or just tow of the same miniboss, its dissapointing to say the least, and hardly even worth it sometimes. still though, the surface content is fun, the main bosses are glorious, and the progression is great. i rocked myself a collosal greatsword throughout the whole gameplay, and enjoyed my time with it.\r\n\r\nquestlines are handled horribly, i think if this game included like a journal book or something that does not provide handholding but just records the conversations i think it would help tremendously. it would have been a hundred percent more tolerable. most of them dont tell you anything and they be as cryptic as possible, hey little tarnished take this sword and give it to a man good luck like what? thats just terrible quest design no matter how you put it.  puzzles are also cryptic and is soemtimes almost impossible without a guide its just such a weird choice to put it in the game.\r\n\r\nthe endgame is actually unfortunately the worst parts of the game. the enemies can kill you in 3 hit, and they themselves are also spongy, and they introduce bosses into normal enemies you encounter occasionally, its just bad. its poor game design at best, at an attempt to make the game difficult. and the final boss is so boring its unbelievable. its unlucky how bad it is in the end but ultimately the game is still fantastic from the start.

You need to pay close attention to what every NPC says along the way and exhaust all dialogue.\n\nJust like with every FromSoftware's souls games, the side quests with various NPCs you meet along the way can be very difficult to figure out what you need to do and when to do it without checking a guide on the internet. Sometimes if you progress the game too far without doing certain steps in a side quest, the quest will be forfeited without warning and you have to try again the next playthrough. You have no journal or similar to keep track of your quests either. This can be very annoying, and is one out of two things that I \"dislike\" with the souls-games, even if it's a minor thing.\n\n[h2]Co-op[/h2]\nThis is the other thing I dislike with the souls games, especially in Elden Ring. You can summon another player to your world to help you on the path to the next boss, and after the boss is slain, the summoned player will be returned to his world. Then you can summon the same player again or another player in the next area if that player has reached that area in his world, and so on.\n\nBecause of the vastness of the world in Elden Ring, the player is given a horse to ride around with and explore the world. This is amazing, but not in Co-Op. The summoned player can NOT use his horse in another player's world. If you want to explore everything with a friend, you have to do it by running, and then you have to do it again in your friend's world. A little tedious if you ask me.\n\n[h2]Combat & Gameplay[/h2]\nThe combat in this game is flawless. Just like Dark Souls 3. If you fail and die over and over again, it's on you, not the game. You just have to practice and get better. There are tons of different builds in the game with so many weapons and spells to choose from, so replayability in this regard is nothing less than fantastic. There is a certain item you need to respec your character though, but you get a lot of them in just one playthrough. You can always make a new character instead if you would like.\n\n[h2]Enemies & Bosses[/h2]\nThere are a good variety of enemies and bosses in the game with varied attack patterns that you have to learn to dodge. Except for some bosses that are roaming the open world and make a return in almost every area. One boss that I don't like that you encounter several times is the Ulcerated Tree Spirit. It often flies up in the air and becomes difficult to keep track of with messed up camera angles. It's also hard to read its attacks, because it's basically just a flying blob of... something. Very annoying.\n\n[h2]The Lands Between[/h2]\nThe world in this game is one of the best and most beautiful worlds I have ever seen in a video game. The exploration part of this game is insane and you just want to explore every corner of the map. I have never had a stronger sense of adventure in any other game. The variety in the world is very good and, well, just very varied. Each area looks different and is just completely stunning. This alone is 10/10 in rating. Well done.\n\n[h2]Constructive Criticism[/h2]\nI do not have much to say here, as the few negatives that exist in the game are heavily overshadowed by all the positives. Side quests and Co-Op play could be better, yes, but this game is still a masterpiece in my opinion. Especially if you play it and complete it solo without the help of others to carry you, which is a greater achievement than completing it in Co-Op after all.\n\n[h2]The Verdict[/h2]\nIf you like FromSoftware and their Dark Souls series, don't hesitate to play Elden Ring. It's basically Dark Souls 3 in an open world. I was completely blown away the first time I played through this game.\n\n[h2]Rating: 10/10[/h2]", "timestamp_created": 1721130851, "timestamp_updated": 1721131736, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169961248": {"recommendationid": "169961248", "author": {"steamid": "76561198268681134", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23905, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21396, "last_played": 1721867638}, "language": "english", "review": "goated", "timestamp_created": 1721086315, "timestamp_updated": 1721086315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519999980926513672", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169914370": {"recommendationid": "169914370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121964318", "num_games_owned": 43, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 19614, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 18352, "last_played": 1721919527}, "language": "english", "review": "Very well designed video game.

It has cool cut scenes, amazing set pieces and a great looking world. Plus it has fantastic costumes and interesting characters. \r\n\r\nThough Elden Ring has an online rep for being very difficult, it is not. Achievement completion rates are very high and combat is very simple. Monster attacks: dodge. Monster recovering: attack. If you do get stuck, you can summon a friend to beat the boss for you\r\n\r\nThe theme gets silly at a certain point. How many people have to maim themselves to get more powerful?? In Elden Ring, almost all of them! The boss with leg issues near the end made me laugh.\r\n\r\nThe AI is very bad. Monsters don't react to being attacked, bosses get stuck on objects, and many bigger monsters are easily exploitable. There is a problem if players need to help the enemies to have an interesting fight. Once I figured out a winning strategy it worked for almost the entire game.\r\n\r\nElden Ring is very repetitive. I generally don't mind this but I found Elden Ring's gameplay to be tedious. Many areas in the game are very similar, if you've seen one catacomb you have seen them all. Invasion encounters all felt the same. I also did not enjoy fighting the same monsters over and over.\r\n\r\nFinally, Elden Ring lacks core RPG features. I can understand why, From Software needed to pad the length of the game. Just figuring out where to go was the bulk of my playtime. Elden Ring would be very short if it had things like a quest log or markers. \r\n\r\n", "timestamp_created": 1720998822, "timestamp_updated": 1720998822, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519647359848022461", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170920682": {"recommendationid": "170920682", "author": {"steamid": "76561199076310046", "num_games_owned": 31, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4786, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "playtime_at_review": 4786, "last_played": 1722680951}, "language": "english", "review": "Radhan is gay", "timestamp_created": 1722126613, "timestamp_updated": 1722126613, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519362211227416992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171456239": {"recommendationid": "171456239", "author": {"steamid": "76561198256677937", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 13437, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1236, "playtime_at_review": 12611, "last_played": 1723383818}, "language": "english", "review": "DLC felt like new years eve with that firework ass spells from radahn", "timestamp_created": 1722816322, "timestamp_updated": 1722816322, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519101142883300781", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171864656": {"recommendationid": "171864656", "author": {"steamid": "76561198838112143", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4366, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 748, "playtime_at_review": 4172, "last_played": 1723353489}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing entry into the Souls Borne series.

Finished them all but DS1, and loved them all. I do not like Elden Ring, because the traditional From formula was hurt too much by the so called \"innovations\", that quite frankly, did nothing just transfom it into an Ubisoft open world game where locations are softlocked by level gating and impossible health pool sponges, pushing Elden Ring back into the early 00s MMO era with enemies standing by in the middle of open fields with 5 meters line of sight.\n\nOpen world is a plague on the beloved From formula that removed masterfully interconnected mazes and short reliefs for riding a horse in the most inconvinient, uncomfortable way. Gone is the art of balancing that made every From game such a diamond where exploration and progress was rewarded with challange that fit the player's power level, as Elden Ring's open world tells you \"if you hit what feels like 1 into the HP pool of 9999999, well, go elsewhere and farm, come back later\". The first optional dungeon I cleared was a cave with a beastmen who used a mixture of Dark Souls 3 special attack animations (you know that somersaulting ninja greatsword everyone and their moms used). 3 hours in, I mostly fought wolves and guard camps, that you can all ignore and run past not in the traditional sense of running by them by a hair doding their attacks, but spotting them on the horizon and deciding \"well f it, I'll go around them\". Progression isn't blocked by enemies stopping you, it's blocked by enforcing farming said enemies until you eventually face a boss.\n\nCombat on horseback feels awful and the open world is made in a way to use your horse nonstop, or spend your precious time running around in the vast emptiness. Trailers of open world games tell you: a vast world to explore! Dark Souls and Sekiro might have been tighter, but understood the difference between exploration and discovery - in Elden Ring, so far I've found nothing worth discovering, even the optional areas and minibosses so far (4 of them I killed) just died, rewarding a handful of runes (experience), but lead to no rewards in terms of items.\n\nNow you have a map, fast travel, crafting, jumping and crouching... and I ended up feeling: damn, I just played a modern Assassin's Creed game. Without the story. Literally crouch sneaking aroung to backstab from bush stealth - that, or fight 1v15. At this point I honestly prefer Assassin's Creed because at least it is honest about it's nature while Elden Ring feels like an identitiy crisis of From Software.\n\nI did not enjoy the experience as a fan of From games. Doesn't mean it's a bad game, but it's not for me so I cannot recommend it. Good thing I waited long enough for a 25 euro purchase, I might give it another go later but... so far it's repulsive.", "timestamp_created": 1722952780, "timestamp_updated": 1722952780, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518248140811920166", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171006901": {"recommendationid": "171006901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198084557749", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6578, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 6578, "last_played": 1722229987}, "language": "english", "review": "Most overrated game of all time.

It is a good game... Not an excellent game! Not an amazing game! It is a GOOD game... Ok? Ok. It's a GOOD game. But it is the worst soulslike I've played.\n\nThe reason for why I think it is the worst is because the open world doesn't add anything to the formula, if anything it just detracts from it. The claustrophobia. Fighting for every inch forwards or backwards. Feeling like you are alone in a world that is out to get you. Yeah that's lost when you can just yeet yourself out of combat on your horse in an open world.\n\nThe crafting is completely superfluous and screams \"everyone else is doing so we should too\". All it does it fluff up the world with microrewards that you start collecting but at a certain point turn around and ask yourself \"why the fuck do I even bother with \"Golden Centipedes\" what can I even do with them? Then you google it and find out that it's for some trash you'll never actually craft.\n\nThe game being so EXCESSIVELY enormous means that there is a lot of recycled content. And I do mean A LOT. I know that two of the early game bosses in Dark Souls became  \"normal\" enemies once you got past the spider babe but in Elden Ring it's just... I dunno, too much. There's so many bosses that get recycled and turned into just elite enemies at a certain point that it devalues them.\n\nThe game has some of the worst enemy design I've ever seen. What I mean by this is specifically the attack animations where an enemy winds up an attack and then just lingers with it fro 2 seconds before deciding to slam down, except sometimes it decides to slam down 0.1 seconds after winding it up, especially if you're drinking an estus. Because of how obnoxiously enormous this game is that thing wears out its welcome real fucking fast and gets extremely annoying towards the end of the game. Enemies don't \"function\" in a believable manner. Their attack animations are so arbitrary that it just fucks with your perception of what you're supposed to do exactly.\n\nThe scaling of the game is just whack as well. I can't explain it properly. You have to see it to understand it unfortunately. But the way that enemies deal damage to you goes fucking insane towards the later stages of the game.\n\nOh and on that note there are more golden seeds (the thing you use to increase the amount of estus flask charges you have to heal/mana yourself) than the cap so at a certain point you can't even use the golden seeds and they become useless.\n\nMost sorceries are absolute dog. There's a palmful of good ones, everything else is complete trash and honestly, since the expansion pack is here it makes me wonder why there hasn't been a rebalancing update to the sorceries to make them more useful. If you aim to be a sorcerer then just look up \"what sorceries are the best\" on your favorite search engine, take note, and ignore the rest because they are complete and utter trash and quite frankly I find it unacceptable. They've made 3 Dark Souls games prior to this that all had \"sorceries\" in it and this is their magnum opus and the sorcery balance is a shitshow.\n\nThe game is good otherwise. Most enemies are fairly designed. The legacy dungeons are the highlight. The game is gorgeous and all that jazz.\n\nBut is it the king shit since shit? No. Not even close.\n\nIt's a good game, but it is the worst soulslike I've played.\n\nSo I think a negative to balance out the simps are in order.", "timestamp_created": 1722624449, "timestamp_updated": 1722624449, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516631662845611572", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171649982": {"recommendationid": "171649982", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044038754", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 13513, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3534, "playtime_at_review": 12012, "last_played": 1723429267}, "language": "english", "review": "Elden rang , he said he wants deez nuts back", "timestamp_created": 1723076029, "timestamp_updated": 1723076029, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516245484352111816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171441074": {"recommendationid": "171441074", "author": {"steamid": "76561199270421791", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5113, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 5113, "last_played": 1652715492}, "language": "english", "review": "Elon musk plays this game", "timestamp_created": 1722797607, "timestamp_updated": 1722797607, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129016876220703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171213209": {"recommendationid": "171213209", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034070049", "num_games_owned": 453, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 20335, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2017, "playtime_at_review": 18655, "last_played": 1723494989}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game, not too hard.

However, there is some fair criticism to be made for some of the final boss's attacks being quite undodgable.", "timestamp_created": 1721490138, "timestamp_updated": 1721490138, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129076480865479", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170193905": {"recommendationid": "170193905", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117923341", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8355, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2045, "playtime_at_review": 7634, "last_played": 1723352009}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 \n\nCURSE YOUU BAYLLEE!", "timestamp_created": 1721338396, "timestamp_updated": 1723031589, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129016876220703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169894333": {"recommendationid": "169894333", "author": {"steamid": "76561199097576035", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 1177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "playtime_at_review": 766, "last_played": 1723084661}, "language": "english", "review": "cant beat elden rings as elden rings", "timestamp_created": 1721006324, "timestamp_updated": 1721006324, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516129016876220703", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170443428": {"recommendationid": "170443428", "author": {"steamid": "76561198816999393", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 37492, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2612, "playtime_at_review": 33272, "last_played": 1723545299}, "language": "english", "review": "\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2820\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u2804\u28a4\u28f4\u28f6\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u289f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28c0\u28e0\u28e4\u287e\u288f\u28a0\u28f6\u28f6\u28fe\u2851\u2840\u28b8\u280b\u2801\u2804\u28a0\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\n\u28e0\u28f6\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u281f\u2801\u2801\u2830\u28cb\u28ab\u28b2\u2847\u281b\u2804\u2804\u2880\u28e0\u28e4\u28c9\u283b\u283f\u283f\n\u28ff\u28df\u28cb\u28c9\u28c1\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u283b\u28c6\u28c2\u2855\u283c\u2802\u2809\u28ff\u28ff\u2847\u288f\u2809\u2809\u2801\n\u28bf\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u2803\u28b8\u288b\u2841\u288a\u2812\u28f2\u2876\u280a\u2881\u28f4\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28e6\u28e6\n\u2804\u2819\u283b\u28ff\u285f\u2804\u2846\u28b8\u28e7\u28fe\u28f6\u28e4\u28e4\u28fe\u287f\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u287b\u28fb\u28ff\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2818\u2820\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u287f\u283f\u283f\u28e5\u28fe\u28ff\u283f\u28db\u2805\u28b0\u28d7\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2838\u28f6\u28f6\u28ff\u28df\u28db\u28db\u28db\u2832\u283f\u28f5\u28ff\u28df\u2885\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28b9\u285f\u280b\u28e0\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28cd\u2851\u2802\u282c\u2889\u28fe\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28a0\u2801\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u283f\u283f\u283f\u283f\u2837\u28b6\u2844\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2818\u2804\u2889\u28c1\u28c0\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u28e4\u2804\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28c0\u2808\u2819\u283f\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u284d\u281f\u2881\u28e0\u28e4\u28f6\u28f6\u28e4\u28c4\u2840\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2880\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u28e6\u28c0\u2809\u283f\u28ff\u2847\u2804\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f6\u2840\n\u2804\u2804\u2804\u2804\u28a0\u28fe\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28f7\u2844\u2839\u2807\u28b0\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff\u28ff", "timestamp_created": 1721611249, "timestamp_updated": 1721611249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515957474708557129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170832503": {"recommendationid": "170832503", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052366733", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 715, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 715, "last_played": 1722026971}, "language": "english", "review": "So this probably wont be popular, but this is not a good game.   I really can't believe the amount of positive reviews it gets.   I'm guessing it's a lot of people who like the franchise.    This is the second time I bought this game.   I returned it the first time and I wish I could this time.   \n\nThe graphics are good and I know it's expected to be hard.   However, IMO there's a lot of mechanics that are broken, at least for the pc.   The targeting system is terrible, google it, don't rely on these reviews. the first thing that comes up is how bad it is for the pc(seems its fine if you use a controller).   Fighting multiple enemies is terrible because the targeting switches.   This is due to the mouse movement, you are not supposed to move your mouse while targeting or it could switch or worse start targeting two and you are moving between two enemies.    Also in another instance I was trying to fight an enemy and figured out it was targeting a soldier sitting down on the other side of the camp.   Seems they don't care about fixing this.\n\nThe next, runes, you need to constantly get rid of them, don't bother to hold them because just in normal game play you can try a door, you can't go back and your hit by a boss from behind, you die and you have no way to go back to get them.   The enemies have all reset and you have to fight your way back to it and if you die, then all those runes are gone.   \n\nThe last thing is, the story, well sucks.   This feels like a game thats basically a mmorpg that's not an mmorpg.   It has none of the good story telliing elements of a good rpg.   It's just a monster hunter, grind game.  \n\nI've played 10+ hours now, made it past stormgrave castle and realized that the game is just not that interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1722027851,

game of guitar hero on max difficulty with invisible button prompts instead of a dueling dance of both push and pull. I wanted to like the bosses, but they're much more frustrating than fun. Hard does not automatically mean fun, and artificial difficulty due to everything hitting like a truck is also not fun. Significant investment into health, heavy armors, and buffs are needed if you don't want to die in 2 hits from a boss.\n\nYou must dodge 4-8 hit combo attacks with a specific series of directional rolls to get in 1 poke before you repeat, and if you pick the wrong direction you'll get smacked with 2-3 of the flurry of follow up attacks that are so tight together that you can't roll them. By the time Elden Ring 3 comes out we'll just be playing OSU in a medieval fantasy setting. My biggest complaint: Spacing isn't a thing anymore because nearly every attack causes the boss to lunge 1/2 way across its arena at you. It's not that every boss has a lunge, it's that every attack is a lunge. Never in a souls game have I died with 10+ healing flasks left so often, because the aggression and lunging and item-use punishing is so overdone. Is this why they added a talisman to SPECIFICALLY be able to chug flasks WHILE being combo'd relentlessly? Sounds like bad design / over-tuned aggression to me.\n\nGame desperately wants you to summon spirit ashes and NPCs or a gaggle of friends to stunlock a boss into oblivion and ignore its mechanics entirely, or else spend hours and tens of deaths learning the specific sequence of dodges and delays so that you can get your 1 poke in per 8 attacks thrown at you.

like.\r\n\r\nI really don't enjoy open worlds, and ER leans into that more heavily that any of the previous entries. For a lot of people, that's a selling point. Not for me, but I don't knock it for it either. It's okay that they made a game not for me.\r\n\r\nThe main problem I have with the game was the relative lack of content spread across the Lands Between like butter across too much bread. There's about 50% more unique boss encounters in ER than there are in DS3, yet those encounters are spread across a map that is an order of magnitude larger. At least like 12x the size of DS3.\r\n\r\nThe way they fix this issue is by copy-pasting encounters, concepts and assets EVERYWHERE. It makes for a very boring and repetitive exploration experience.\r\n\r\nThat said, the DLC actually strikes a finer balance and gives you a smaller (but still pretty huge) map with a lot more unique content per square mile. It's also got some of the best encounters in the Souls franchise history.\r\n\r\nI still like Elden Ring... but just barely.

It's pretty hard and without much guidance, but seems interesting so far and I haven't even started getting into the story. I can see why people love it, it IS a good game. Just not for me. I'll definitely give it a few more hours to decide if I'll try finishing it.\n\nI'm not even 3 hours in (part of it being the tutorial) and I've died *~10x MORE times* than all the very hard / legendary total war campaigns I've quit/lost over the past *2 decades*. E.g.:\n- I got attacked by the first random soldier I encountered\n- I tried to sneakily attack some camp, only to get ganged by a dozen soldiers\n- I fell into some swamp area, and died from the fall. Then tried to retrieve my body but got stuck at the bottom and couldn't figure out if I should go deeper or try to get out, tried the first but kept dying, then decided to leave but got some random OP NPC who was deleting me in seconds (...until I figured I can just run around until another random NPC spawns and kills the first one)\n- Finally I went fighting some random dead monkey for an hour before I decided to stop for the day. \n\nThat last one is a good example of what I mean by \"not much guidance\". After somewhere between 5-10 attempts I had improved enough to get a sense of how I'm supposed to fight (run/dodge a certain way first, 1-2 hits at most, repeat until dead) but it just seems tedious to try another 10 times until I nail it. Of course I thought it was the way I'm supposed to go to progress the story, so I googled it. Well, it's not. Turns out folks online say: 1) run past it without fighting, 2) it's towards the 3rd boss (somehow I missed the first two, lol), and 3) you can do it at any level, but 20+ is recommended (/me facepalms not even knowing what I'm doing and being ~10).\n\nAnd I'm still not quite sure I understand how the various actions work, let alone how to combine them efficiently. Sadly, not all of the key binding are visible in the keyboard settings screen (or maybe some are in different places?) for me to double-check, so I'll also need to redo the tutorial.\n\nPhew.\n\n(Edit at ~9 hours): Still not my kind of game, obviously. Some level grinding, item upgrading, getting more used to the mechanics, and can confidently kill the first tree sentinel with *almost* no damage, and the \"monkey\" (which is actually a troll, and it wasn't towards the \"3rd boss\" but towards the first), and then -less confidently- the first boss (Margit) after ~4-5 attempts and with the help of the summoned sorcerer. Died much less but still plenty. There is some guidance... if you speak to NPCs multiple times since they don't explain everything on the first attempt, but it's not so annoying, in fact I think it's decent. A few annoyances with the UI, and a few with combat (F you, stun-lock!). I'll play a little more, who knows, I might end up actually liking it.\n\n(Edit at ~13 hours): Dying less and less, killed a bunch of small bosses (dragon, two rats(?), one more I'm forgetting). Some interactions were buggy. I STILL cannot pick up the mechanics well enough to fight bosses, and even though I'm level 37 I can barely progress towards any direction in the map without finding opponents that destroy me. So I end up needing to farm more and more, which is becoming more and more boring & annoying. The few NPCs I've spoken to haven't helped me much with understanding what the story is about either. And for lots of game systems (e.g. crafting, magic) I probably missed the explanations because I have no idea how to use them. For that I'd need to search online but I'm not doing it for a game I don't even like. Same for build/combat guides. All in all, it's neither a great game nor a terrible one, and definitely not for everyone.

identical dragon with a paint job i stop to wonder - hasn't game design advanced or improved at all since the NES days? As i fight yet another night cavalry boss with the only defining difference being increased health and damage i realize that no, they have not. As i fight yet another regular enemy disguised as a boss, a dark thought forms in the corner of my mind that things might even have gotten worse.\n\nElden Ring is a game with an astounding amount of repetition. Many bosses are reused an upwards of four or five times with no meaningful differences, few of which are worth fighting to begin with. Anything that initially seems like a cool, secret sub-boss will reveal itself to be just one in a chain of mercilessly repeating fights. \n\nA boss that ambushes you by merchants at nighttime? Awesome. \nOnly he appears several more times, behaving in exactly the same way, and also appears as a regular boss.\n\nIf you do chance on finding a proper boss you then have to pray that it's not either trivially easy or an obnoxious gimmick boss.\nOther choice examples are regular enemies at the end of mini-dungeons, except now they have latin chanting and an inflated health bar so i guess it's a boss now.\n \nWe descend a step deeper into hell when we realize that repetition and shallow design isn't limited to enemies but to the world itself; hope you enjoyed these ruins with a cellar, you'll be seeing it again at least once in every area. \nHere's a mine with some smithing stones, only now the miners have a blue hue. Or green. Possibly red, if we're feeling really saucy. Design elements are reused and repeated in a way usually reserved for cheap asset flips.\n\nIt's a surprise that Elden Ring didn't ship with a predatory currency scheme or subscription fee, since the open world smacks of gacha/MMO design. There is nothing exciting or unique to uncover, it's just a race to find the identical landmarks in each area - an exhaustive study of absolute tedium and cynical game design. \n\nAny piece of good level design is therefore painfully stretched out across hours of pointless travelling. Each catacomb, cave and little castle is a single complete level, so painfully cut up and stretched across so much time and space to justify the open world.\nThe rewards are deeply unsatisfying besides: You'll quickly find a weapon and outfit you want to use, rendering everything else trash that you won't even bother to sell. Crafting ingredients for a system you have nearly zero incentive to engage with.  \nSo, [b]so[/b] many berries, bones and mushrooms. So little in the way of actual reward. Dung ahead indeed.\n\nCombat is improved, but much of it only really applies to fighting random mooks that you quickly demolish anyway. Extremely abusable poise mechanics. AI that still can't deal with anything remotely ranged. Status effects that are either worthless or insanely overpowered.\n\nThere [u]are[/u] good bosses, they're just very few and far between. If you've been unfortunate and foolish enough to actually bother exploring the game world, chances are you'll be massively overlevelled and absolutely trash these encounters anyway.\n\nThe story is... fine. Absolutely fine. Just as fine as the identical story beats were back in Demon's Souls, when a bad thing happens, all the normal people became fentanyl addicts and the giant people went violently insane. \nThings were good, now its bad and all the doors are either foggy or don't open in the direction you want.  Exactly as fine as the same story elements and exposition were in, Dark Souls 1, 2 and 3. \nHere's an ominous narration, implications of an original sin, a metaphysical cycle of death and rebirth and some more chanting.\n\nAs I'm writing this, vicariously reliving my bitterness towards Elden Ring i'm not struck by anything that really balances out the bad parts.  It's more of the same From Software, except in the parts where it's worse.  Or worse than worse, drawn out over so, so many hours of nothing. It's a Soulslike stretched out way past its limit to accommodate an open world, that just doesn't work for the format.\n\nIt's a game that's drudgery on a level that can only be considered mental warfare, a game where I've spent countless hours not making interesting decisions or struggling against difficult bosses, but just desperately been trying to chew through an insanely dense and flavorless mass of boredom. May God have mercy on my soul.\n\nFinal, revised score:\n3/100.\n\nWill still probably play the DLC.\n", "timestamp_created": 1721902556, "timestamp_updated": 1721902556, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507422208786010742", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171367418": {"recommendationid": "171367418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198095544557", "num_games_owned": 170, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1185, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1185, "last_played": 1717612149}, "language": "english", "review": "Although I understand the reasoning of the developers, I am not good enough to enjoy the game.\nFor me, progressing leads to a million repetitions of the same fights, it is ungodly frustrating and when I beat a boss I am more relieved that I don't have to see it again and asking why am I suffering through a game that I am clearly too bad to enjoy.\n\nSo, as they have the right to not give me a lower difficulty level, I have the right to uninstall, regret I spent the money and give them a negative review.", "timestamp_created": 1722704011, "timestamp_updated": 1722704011, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507413506507873535", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171655309": {"recommendationid": "171655309", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361144956", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 20823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 244, "playtime_at_review": 20785, "last_played": 1723086258}, "language": "english", "review": "Simply one of the greatest, most astonishing games ever made.", "timestamp_created": 1723083896, "timestamp_updated": 1723083896, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507364988327026367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171655269": {"recommendationid": "171655269", "author": {"steamid": "76561199203954076", "num_games_owned": 39, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 6951, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 477, "playtime_at_review": 6684, "last_played": 1723231102}, "language": "english", "review": "absolute videogame\r\n\r\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1723083851, "timestamp_updated": 1723083851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507364988327026367", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170686377": {"recommendationid": "170686377", "author": {"steamid": "76561199392674702", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 73, "playtime_at_review": 9878, "last_played": 1723214137}, "language": "english", "review": "miyazaki deserves to be rotting underground in a wooden box, being eaten by worms", "timestamp_created": 1721893946, "timestamp_updated": 1721893946, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.507270753383636475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171975145": {"recommendationid": "171975145", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121848502", "num_games_owned": 110, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 982, "playtime_at_review": 7711, "last_played": 1723372509}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly a lot of fun.

The amount of flexibilty and freedom you have in just the first main area of the game is insane. Wanna go fight the first major boss immediately? Sure, go ahead. Wanna skip the first two major bosses entirely? You can do that. Also, adding the sheer amount of weapons that are available for you to level up and use, which is over 300. You're sure to find one that fits your playstyle.\r\n\r\nHowever, as a souls game, Elden Ring is VERY confusing, There is no clear guide, and just a few Sites of Grace to lead you along. With over 30 side quests/questlines, and almost no hints as to where some items are that you have to get for quests, you'll most likely have to search up guides for a few necessary items. There were multiple times where I had multiple tabs open just to keep track of my progress in some quests. \r\n\r\nBut it is SUCH a good game, with just a few flaws, but that doesn't make it easy (again, its a souls game). I shouldn't have to explain the difficulty, but its one of the easier souls games. With many areas to explore, many ways to play, and many mechanics like Affinities and Ashes Of War, Elden Ring is a game that you'll never forget, and I would recommend anyone I know to play-through this game at least once.", "timestamp_created": 1722441942, "timestamp_updated": 1722441942, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505494534969329834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170907253": {"recommendationid": "170907253", "author": {"steamid": "76561198400837435", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 145, "playtime_at_review": 6518, "last_played": 1722465326}, "language": "english", "review": "game is horrible and a waste of my time it is too difficult I prefer easier games and over all it is worse than father on a late Friday night after downing 1L, would highly recommend.", "timestamp_created": 1722109815, "timestamp_updated": 1722110034, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505494534969329834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170522274": {"recommendationid": "170522274", "author": {"steamid": "76561198207100373", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 5223, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4905, "last_played": 1721762287}, "language": "english", "review": "I've sunk 81 hours and I could do 810 more.

"language": "english", "review": "I am still far from the end of the game but this has been a blast.\r\nThis is pretty much a souls game but with less of the unfair stuff and more freedom on how to approach things.\r\n\r\nThe whole \"open world\" aspect scared me at first because we all know how open worlds are, filled with meaningless filler but at the same time very empty.\r\nWhile there are some places without much, there is a lot to do, and no shining icon everywhere so you need to explore and find things.\r\n\r\nFor example, very soon after starting, the game tells you \"follow the lights\", which quickly pits you against a giant troll that will maim most new players (and before that there is even a big knight on a horse that is not meant to be defeated at that point).\r\nIt teaches you from experience like the old souls game did, but this time it also tells you \"if you don't feel that you can tackle this right now, go do other things, it's fine to come back later\".\r\n\r\nExploring a bit would have you find a duo of trolls that are chained to a wagon and that don't have a massive sword on top of only being agressive if you attack them, meaning that you can fight one at a time and a weaker version of the troll that barred your way.\r\n\r\nUnlike old souls games, you have a lot more completely valid choices in how to build your character.\r\nUsing a tower shield and relying on the new counter-attacks (completely different from parries), bows, various styles of magic, a large range of weapons available early on, pretty much everything can end up being potent.\r\nOf course old souls game also had a bunch of builds that worked but it feels a lot more open in this aspect as well.\r\n\r\nHaving access to \"summons\" in special areas and most bosses allows you to further pick what you want to use.\r\nFor example, a magic caster can summon some powerful helpers that can survive for quite a while and get the attention on them, allowing the player to not always being focused down, giving plenty of time to cast spells instead of spending most of the fight dodging around and trying to get a spell off every now and then.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not like the game is easy, there are plenty of tough enemies and bosses that will challenge the player, small dungeons and the bigger story dungeons are also closer to how souls games were designed (tighter areas with plenty of shortcuts and many enemies that can catch you off-guard).\r\nIt is a just bit less frustrating to players with a lower skill level.\r\n\r\nAlso to note is that you can't be invaded randomly if you are playing by yourself, even online.\r\nSo you can still play with messages on the ground and blood puddles everywhere without having to fear invasions everywhere.\r\nIt might not be a positive point for those that enjoy invading but it is a big plus for many of us more casual players that quit some of the previous games due to invasions happening quite frequently.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I am having a great time with this game even after defeating the first two \"great rune\" bosses.", "timestamp_created": 1721522071, "timestamp_updated": 1721522071,

Unfortunately, the actual game design makes it kind of a terrible game.  The first major issue is that you can fast travel to every checkpoint from anywhere.  This means you're pretty much never in danger.  You can't get deep into trouble like in DS1.  Also, the world is tiny as a result, the distance from you to anything else is just whatever the closest checkpoint is, and a short horse ride.\r\n\r\nThe horse is the next issue.  It trivializes fighting.  In general, the difficulty curve in this game is really really really awful.  Enemies are either one-hit to kill, or they one-hit kill you.   The pacing is broken because it's an open world game, just like the pacing is broken in every other open world game.  Because of these bad difficulty curves, I found myself running into brick walls that I could easily warp back to, and instead just warping out to go fight something easier for a bit.  There's always something trivial to level up on, so there's no real challenge.  And once again, being able to warp everywhere makes it so there's no real investment.\r\n\r\nThe design in this game is amazing.  And the more linear areas are also very well done.  But most of this game is just open world junk.  DS1 pretended to give no direction, but funnels you into the right path.  This one doesn't.  You just wander aimlessly until it gets to hard, then go somewhere else and wander aimlessly.\r\n\r\nI want to feel like my back is against the wall.  I want to sweat.  I want a challenge.  Occasionally the bosses would give me that, but -- once again -- most were either way too easy, or nearly impossible.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, fast-travel kills both the immersion and the difficulty curve.  It's really too bad.  I think this could be a really good game if they just made it so warping could only be done between distinct locations.  It also would have forced them to design areas to have reasonable difficulty curves that don't turn you back halfway through.  It would corner players into difficult situations where they have to challenge themselves.  It would be a real souls game.", "timestamp_created": 1723319091, "timestamp_updated": 1723319091, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "171814374": {"recommendationid": "171814374", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007073231", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3717, "playtime_at_review": 3683, "last_played": 1723314164}, "language": "english", "review": "Just a general impression after investing 60 hours in this game. If you are looking to buy an open-world game, there are a couple of things to highlight.\r\n\r\nPositives:\r\n\r\nVisually beautiful open-world experience followed by great music which makes the atmosphere incredible\r\nHad only 2 crashes in 60 hours\r\n\r\n\r\nNegatives:\r\n\r\nExtremely shallow open-world mechanics\r\nReused assets, copy-pasted dungeons, and bosses\r\nHorrible PC controls and camera tracking\r\nPoor PC optimization\r\nNo in-game journal makes tracking quests impossible\r\nMost of the loot is useless\r\nHorrible AI that is very easy to cheese (including bosses)\r\nAfter Leynndall, the quality and balance of the final mountain region completely ruined the game\r\n\r\nAs an extra, I will try to describe the actual in-game loop and general mechanics:\r\n\r\n90% of the time is riding from one site of grace towards the next undiscovered one. The site of grace is a checkpoint that will refill your flasks (potions) and fill your HP. Once unlocked, it will also provide you with a fast travel option.

The lore seems purposely designed now to pad the bank account of one Australian YouTuber and no longer impishly convoluted. I loved my time with Bloodborne and Dark Souls. I merely liked my time in Elden RIng and I realized I am more excited to move on, where as I played DS3 consistently until the day Elden Ring came out. Maybe I have changed. But I rather feel it is something deep in Elden RIng that is not what many FromSoft fans want.

Some of these are:\r\n- Buffs/Debuffs have no explanation besides an icon under the character stats (health, fp, stamina). If you go to the character status screen, it is also not explained there. This feels simply lazy, not even a lousy tooltip for a basic explanation is shown. You really need to Alt+Tab out of the game and lookup in a wiki if you actually want to figure out what's going on. This in itself should knock a point off a 10 score.\r\n- There is no way to compare an item from a seller to what you have, even if you have it equipped. You either take the time to snap a picture of its stats, end the interaction with the seller, then compare with what you have, or get good at memorising these stats. Otherwise, you will find yourself going back end forth between your inventory and the seller (after skipping the same dialog over and over again, seems annoyance by repetition is a trademark of the game), just to be able to determine if what you have is better then what the seller has to offer.\r\n- The whole UI is very confusing and unnecessarily split (like inventory and equipment, whilst most games figured out how to have both at the same time, here you do have to swap between the two for certain things). There are also no shortcuts to go directly to the dedicated screens (inventory, character status, etc), it always requires 2 steps to get there.\r\n\r\nThere are many sources of frustrations that have nothing to do with skill. For a PC player, that have many keys at your disposal, can't even make weapon or skill selections bound to numbers and worse, you need to go through all of what you have equipped to go back to the first item (there are no quick slots that can be associated to numbers or some key, with the exception of the pouch which is hardly the most useful. Being able to swap equipped weapons or incantations in an easy and convenient way is an afterthought). This makes it quite obvious is a console port.\r\n\r\nAll of these make it unnecessarily more difficult what is already not an easy game.\r\nClearing the same mobs, spend 10 minutes doing that, to then die in 15 seconds in a boss, rinse and repeat is not a fun experience. You may argue that this is about skill or that you should level up more before attempting that again, but often that leads to loosing your current accumulated runes (This weird currency for levelling up, which is also used for purchasing items). This grinding shouldn't be necessary and the single shot you have to recover your XP lost from your most recent death often leads to frustration, specially when there is the chance of death before you get to the location of your most recent death and this is quite likely when your re-spawn location requires you to clear a large number of NPCs or you have to go through a place with a high risk of being killed by the environment (falls, traps, etc).\r\nI have never had to play a game that demands repetition. It feels worse than games that require and endless amount of gathering for quests. At least on these you don't have to reset your progress every time you fail, or prevent you to have a save game closer to your target challenge. Some things just don't make sense. And whilst the game is mostly really cool and fun, it is definitely not a 10/10 and could definitely use a bit more thought on quality of life aspects of the game.", "timestamp_created": 1721587927, "timestamp_updated": 1721587927, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170297785": {"recommendationid": "170297785", "author": {"steamid": "76561197967127119", "num_games_owned": 507, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7247, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 7245, "last_played": 1721487736}, "language": "english", "review": "I recently finished the base game and right after it the DLC.\nI liked both, but that being said:\n- I feel like the base game was better balanced, whereas the DLC difficulty spike was enormous (especially at the start).

I highly recommend it, and here's why:\n\nLike many who play this game, this was my first \"Soulsborne/Soulslike\" game, as it is the most refined and user-friendly version of FromSoftware's game design ethos. I avoided the Dark Souls series for many years. I had a presumptuous view of FromSoftware and their visual aesthetic that made me feel this game was just sad edgelord material. [b]I was so wrong.[/b] \n\nLike all FromSoftware games, Elden Ring revels in struggle. Only the most basic combat mechanics are explained to the player; the rest is trial and error. It challenges you to tease out its mysteries, not just of the world and lore, but of the combat mechanics and UI. The game asks you to [i]STRUGGLE[/i] (you need to be open to that to fully enjoy it), and oh boy, did I struggle...\n\nI struggled to simply navigate the user interface, to find the extra info on weapon damage and scaling, armor ratings and status defenses, even item descriptions full of implicit lore that give the player a small understanding of what's happening in the Lands Between. I struggled to accept that not every field boss in the overworld was meant to be defeated when you first encounter them. I struggled to avoid traps and ambushes. Even when I gave up trying to play solo and attempted to use the Co-Op multiplayer system, I struggled to understand the seemingly obtuse system of items that enable it. Even after, I struggled against skilled and relentless Invaders, many of whom have been invading players since Dark Souls 1. I'm ashamed to say I struggled to not uninstall the game and play an easier one with a more forgiving learning curve. Such was my frustration.\n\nMost of all, I struggled to get acclimated to the combat mechanics... Until, a whole 40 hours (and many deaths) in, something clicked. I started seeing and feeling a flow to combat, requiring a skillful dance between dodging perfectly [i]into[/i] attacks and identifying narrow windows for my own attacks. I started to understand every movement and attack option's purpose and viability in different scenarios. I started understanding how to most efficiently manage my stamina, consumables, and other resources. I started seeing challenges and opportunities where before I only saw difficulties and defeat.\n\nThis began a shift in my mentality. The developers were not taunting or trolling me, like many players seem to think; they were inviting me to experience a true power fantasy, to feel a tangible sense of actual progression in skill and understanding. The game does not \"git gud, noob\"; it says [b]\"rise, Tarnished\"[/b].\n\nSo many modern AAA games are released with a product mentality first and foremost, and not even as good products; they are often unfinished, rushed, bugged, and bloated with profit-maximizing strategies like microtransactions. Elden Ring is the first game I've played in a decade that felt like a complete game, full of hundreds of hours of content. \n\nSo many games frontload their \"best\" content and force you to engage with it to force your interest, but much of Elden Rings best content is hidden or blocked by combat and platforming challenges. I have almost 3k hours logged, and I'm still finding out new things the game has kept hidden from me. This speaks so much to the confidence the developers have in their vision of an adventure fantasy game centered around discovery.\n\nThe game is not perfect. There are still some bugs and glitches present from launch that have no clearcut development solution. Many bosses, enemy types, and other assets are re-used all over the map to mixed effect. Some lategame and endgame content feels rushed and spread out. Perhaps worst of all, like all games with an active PvP element, the player community is rife with toxic players who seem hellbent on griefing others into making them uninstall the game.\n\nEven with these glaring imperfections, this game shines like a diamond in a sea of coal coated with cheap craft glitter. It stands head and shoulders above almost all other modern AAA games in terms of intrigue, combat satisfaction, exploration, and story, and it doesn't even flaunt it. An understated and nuanced gaming experience is such a delight in an era where games are intended to feel more like blockbuster Hollywood movies rather than progressive adventures. Elden Ring is the culmination of FromSoftware\u2019s singular and robust design philosophy, honed over decades of trial and error. \n\n[b]If you experience only one Soulsbourne game in your entire life, let it be Elden Ring.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1717617752, "timestamp_updated": 1718407660, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1648, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score":

Having made the switch to PC gaming, i wanted to replay it on Steam to be ready for the DLC.\n\nSome people will tell you that Elden Ring is the easiest game from FromSoftware and well, they're right to some extent. This mainly lies in two things: first, the open world structure allows you to skip a boss if you're feeling overwhelmed to come back later, after getting more levels and gear. That's something you couldn't really do in their previous entries. Also, you have access to a variety of powerful tools: weapons, skills, builds and summons that can make your journey much easier.\n\nYou want to do it the hardest way possible? Great, skip those, you're in for a challenge. You could use some help? Use them or summon a friend to assist you. I can perfectly understand that some people have busy lives with work and kids and don't want to spend their game time wiping dozens of time on a boss, but still want to experience the FromSoft touch. There's no better way, just play the way that gives you the most fun.\n\nThe game is Exploration with a capital E. No symbols to tell you where to go, no quest diary. It can be intimidating, specially if you tend to have FOMO. The good part is that, by closely looking at the map, you will find clues to places of interest. The play area is huge, so is the content. At times i felt like it was too much, but at least you can't accuse FromSoft to deliver you an incomplete game.\n\nSome graphical assets are heavily reused, that's true, but it didn't really bother me that much. Speaking of graphics, if you like dark fantasy atmospheres, oh boy, you're in for a treat.\n\nThat game is making FromSoft accessible to a wider array of players and it's perfectly fine with me.",

FromSoftware, you\u2019ve seriously outdone yourselves. Elden Ring is nothing short of phenomenal, and it's hard to imagine how you'll ever top this.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped into this vast, mysterious world, I was hooked. The blend of deep lore, challenging combat, and stunning landscapes is just incredible. The gameplay is smoth and perfectly balanced, making every fight feel like a rewarding test of skill.\n\nExploring the world of Elden Ring is pure joy. It's packed with secrets, hidden paths, and lore that keeps you wanting more. The environmental storyteling is so rich that every corner of the map feels worth investigating. Each region has its own uniqie look and feel, so exploration never gets boring.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the only thing that annoys me: the catacombs or dungeons. This has been a problem since Bloodborne (my favorite game of all time). Even though Elden Ring does it better than Bloodborne, every dungeon still feels a bit like an AI-generated copy-paste job. But hey, they\u2019re still fun.\n\nThe character builds you can create in Elden Ring are better than in any Souls game before it. Whether you\u2019re into melee combat, magic, or a mix of both, the depth here is just amazing.\n\nIn short, Elden Ring isn\u2019t just a game; it\u2019s an experience. FromSoftware has set a new standard for the genre and maybe created a new genre, and I can\u2019t wait to see what they do with the DLC.

It's just [i] that [/i] good. \n\nWhile yes, I do have over 80 hours played at the time of writing this review, I'm still not entirely finished with the game. I'm currently at the endgame of the base game and still have tons to explore and do (not to mention the DLC I have started a few hours ago).\n\nNow for the game itself: Yes, it's good. The art direction, voice acting and lore are unlike any other I've seen before. Sure, the graphics don't look too \"realistic\" either, but the great art direction and style make up for it - giving it a rich world surrounded by some colorful and great looking regions in the world itself.\n\nIf this is your first FromSoft (or Soulsborne) game like it was mine, don't go into it expecting it to be easy from the get-go. It was hard.

I just couldn't handle it. On the other hand, Western style story telling was more serious and had more intriguing concepts but were executed poorly and lacked a soul to keep me interested. This game is the perfect middle ground because this world was created by George R. R.

The weapon variety give you a lot of options and allows for a lot of replayability. \nOther than that, I truly believe that the game also helps you learn to concentrate a lot in crucial moments, which doesn't necessarily have to pertain to videogames. \n\nFor my first souls game, I'm really impressed and wish to discover some of the previous iterations later down the line. \nIf you've got it wishlisted or heard from friends but you still remain uncertain as I was, I highly recommend that you give it a go.", "timestamp_created": 1720546668, "timestamp_updated": 1722215866, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.645161330699920654", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "167767552": {"recommendationid": "167767552", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125127193", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 43, "playtime_forever": 6627, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4746, "last_played": 1719333550}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a review for the base game, which i finished after 75 hours of gameplay.\n\nI'll start this by saying that I've never liked soulslike games, and have tried some but never bought one prior to trying Elden Ring out. I decided to give it a shot as a personal challenge after hearing very good things about it... and I'm glad I did. I quickly realised this was going to be a once in a lifetime experience.\n\nI think there is nothing quite like Elden Ring, sure FromSoftware has made plenty of games of the same genre, but this is their first attempt at an open world game of the sorts, which also translates to some rough edges, as I'll discuss later. I think however that the amount of effort and creativity that went into this product is absolutely insane and very different from the western gaming industries' standards we are so used to today. I will ignore all of the things that remind me of lord of the rings a bit too much for it to be just a coincidence, and tell you that the feeling, the setting, the environment, the vibe of ER are almost unmatched.  Wherever I went and whatever I did in this game demanded me to stop by, look in awe, take a screenshot and share it to some of my friends. I spent so many hours not even doing any quest at the start, but simply unlocking all areas of the map, trying to find as many sites of grace as possible, exploring all the dungeons I could, obsessively looking at the map to try and spot areas that were too suspiciously empty for them not to hold any secret.\n\nBecause yes, ER will not hold your hand with anything apart from a very basic combat tutorial at the beginning and some generic menu navigation tutorials here and there, so you can forget about a quest journal or map markers. Not having much experience with soulslike games I felt a bit lost in the beginning with some uncertainties about my goals and massive uncertainties about what I was even doing, lore-wise. But I'd be lying if I said it didn't feel extremely rewarding to figure stuff out on my own, as ER is a game about facing and overcoming challenges, even when it means to give up just to come back later with more experience... and better gear.\n\nAnd man getting gear in this game is addicting, be it armour, weapons, talismans, ashes or just crafting materials, this game was designed to make you become a loot goblin. It is so rewarding to 100% areas or making sure you picked everything up from a dungeon, knowing that if you didn't you could've missed something really important and/or useful.\n\nEverything you pick up serves in one way or another to make you stronger and face more difficult challenges as the game progresses, but that will only be half of the job. The other half is getting good at ER. This game isn't easy, and it never got to the point where it became easy even with the best gear ever, because some areas of the game are just that difficult. However learning a boss's combos and finally being able to defeat it after 40 tries is definitely a feeling very few games can deliver. \n\nAnd you can really be yourself in this game. Apart from the very awfully outdated skyrim-like character creation menu, the game has so many armour choices that you can mix and match endless possibilities, without even considering the immense variety of builds you can try out to fit your playstyle and overcoming obstacles, making the game's rpg elements really stand out.\n\nUnfortunately not all difficulties the game throws at you are by design. Some, in fact, are objectively just [i] bad [/i] design. First of all this is a console game, ported to PC. For the more tech savvy of you this should be enough to make you understand what is wrong with this game, but if it isn't: 1) the controls for m/k in this game are an absolute joke. Crouching with X? Jumping with F??? Having to use arrow keys to swap your equipped items? And that super inconsistent finger-breaking combo to hold the weapon with 2 hands? lol. I saved myself the hassle and played on controller, but even there, as a console game, the controls were honestly very bad, not intuitive and led to a lot of very frustrating moments. 2) Game locked to 60 fps? for a 2022 game? I honestly bursted out laughing. Fixed with a mod. 3) The UI, oh god the UI and menu navigation. Can we not talk about it? The fact that FromSoftware has never addressed any of these issues with any game they've made, not even their new flagship, goes to show that they are allowed with getting away with a lot of things other companies would get bashed for, thanks to their cult-like fanbase.\n\nWith these hardcoded issues out of the way, you should know this game has some very unfair fights if you're using certain builds, but I supposed balancing the game around a billion builds isn't possible, so be ready for that. Another thing you should be aware of is the fact you drop your currency when you die. In order to pick it up you have to respawn and retrieve it where you died, and if you die another time that currency is lost forever no matter how much you had. Words cannot describe how incredibly stupid and awful said mechanic is in an open world game, and if it wasn't because of a mod to remove it entirely this would've easily been a negative review, as it would've entirely ruined the whole exploration aspect of the game, which is one of if not the best part of it. So if you're playing vanilla get used to always being broke, not because you're going to lose it, but because you're constantly going to spend it being afraid that you'll lose it. \n\nHaving absolutely no guidance from the game isn't a 100% good thing either. If you tell me you've done all the side quests in the game without looking up a guide on youtube you're simply a liar. In fact, I fully expect each and every single one of you to have looked up at the very least more than half of them on your first playthrough, as there is simply no logic nor guidance whatsoever about where to go and what to do most of the times, with some things making absolutely no sense at all. The game doesn't explain a lot of important mechanics or items either, so expect to play with the wiki or a youtube video open from start to finish if you really want to get the most out of the game.\n\nThe game offers 6 different endings, plenty of odd, optional or not, twists and a lot of hidden secrets to unfold, but it will not care if you miss out. You need to be resourceful, attentive, adventurous and smart, or this is going to be just another open world game for you.\n\nWith all of that said, ER is an incredible game when it comes to world building, environmental story telling, stunning visuals, satisfying victories, map design and amount of content.

The reason I am writing a negative review is that I am fed up with the stupid design choices that have been continuing since Dark Souls 1, and no one is talking about the [u] obvious problems [/u] of Elden Ring. I will point out the game's flaws in my own way, hoping that maybe, even if it's just a small chance, other players will do the same, and they will make this quality game even better.\n\n[h2] NPC Questlines [/h2]\nThe same classic silly setup that has been continuing since Dark Souls 1 persists in this game as well. The difficulty of completing NPC quests and coming across them [strike] let's admit it, 90% of players complete these quests by looking at guides. [/strike] , but even if I overlook that, the progression of the quests is the same. We press the interaction button repeatedly with NPCs who stand like statues. After doing this three times in different locations, the NPC quest is completed. Sure, at the end of some quests we fight and so on, but the process is the same: press the talk button, then press it again at the next location, and continue. I wonder if anyone is genuinely affected by these mostly depressive NPC stories. There are no cutscenes or cinematic settings; they are just immobile statues. This needs to be improved\n\n[h2] Open World [/h2]\nElden Ring has a much larger map compared to its previous games, but this beautiful and large map is filled with many repetitive bosses and identical dungeons even the creatures inside the dungeons are the same However, the thing that most undermines the sense of exploration is this: you're traveling in a location, defeating enemies specifically placed to frustrate the player, and the result? You are rewarded with crappy material or an item you won't even remember the name of. Instead of these useless items, they should include enemy armor sets, weapons, and items with different low drop rates. This would make the sense of exploration much more satisfying and save players from meaningless and unenjoyable grinding.\n\n[h1] Storyline and narrative [/h1]\n:D\n\n[h2] The Bosses [/h2]\nThe bosses in Elden Ring are really great, both in terms of design, environment, and patterns. Generally, they are good, but it's clear that some are filled with unnecessary aoe damage and sometimes excessively high damage just to make the boss fight very difficult and frustrating for players. I'm not saying the bosses impossible to beat. I believe the aoe combos they  should be balanced, and the damage they inflict should be slightly reduced.\n\n[h1] The End [/h1]\nDespite its many flaws, Elden Ring is a high quality game, and I will continue playing it.

Once known as Limgrave, it is now a land of shadows, tinged with an unsettling hue influenced by the Erdtree, which emanates an energy far from positive. The monster scaling mechanics are merciless, and the bosses are masterfully designed and highly unpredictable. Following in the footsteps of Miquella, the journey unfolds across a relatively small map, yet brimming with layers upon layers of FromSoftware's intricate design.\r\n\r\nEverything is executed to near perfection. However, a few elements prevent this expansion from surpassing the side content of previous FromSoftware titles and earning the moniker of \"Greatest Expansion Ever.\" These include the super boss known as Prime Radahn (akin to a community-created boss mod), the erratic performance of the latest update, and the slightly hollow feeling after unraveling Miquella's story and motives.\r\n\r\nI give this expansion an 8/10. In my heart, it stands as the winner of \"Best Ongoing Game 2024\" and \"Best Expansion of the Year 2024.\"\r\n\r\n-SHADOW OF THE ERDTREE-", "timestamp_created": 1720310868, "timestamp_updated": 1720310868, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.586058497428894043", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 452503, "total_negative": 30462, "total_reviews": 482965}, "cursors": {"AoIIPwqRl3rvj4sF": "Tue Aug 13 16:34:08 2024", "AoIIPwui8Hqfv4gF": "Tue Aug 13 16:34:18 2024"}}
