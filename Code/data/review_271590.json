Great multiplayer, huge LOT of quality content, still updating after all those years. GTA Online updates are like full-time DLCs and game does NOT require you to pay a single cent more to play them.\r\n\r\nBack in the days when Rockstar banned the most common third-party cheat for GTA Online, cheaters started giving GTA 5 bad reviews. This game did not deserve such toxic reviewing. Since then the third-party cheats started to be more complex.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this is a huge affliction for the game. From my experience (Central Europe) there is at least one cheater on 90% of all public sessions (servers). These cheaters are griefing, bullying, ruining the game on all fronts. Their thorough third-party cheats can shutdown your game just with a single command, which happened to me many times. Freshly, they allegedly can give on your account a permanent ban on GTA Online. Reporting these cheaters can be comfortly done via pause menu, but it feels like the justice may never come to them. Also it is hard to know who is the cheater - they may kill other players by your own nickname. You can play GTA Online alone or with your friends in private sessions but you may miss some content that appears only in public sessions.\r\n\r\nPS: By the time I am writing this review, Rockstar recently launched new official Community Guidelines where they - among other things - emphasized reporting such bad behavior. From the new Guidelines, it seems that Rockstar Support may be more active in punishing cheaters and more helpful to the victims. Time will see, let's hope for the best.\r\n\r\nCheating is for cowards \u2665", "timestamp_created": 1721671624, "timestamp_updated": 1721671624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.557046949863433838", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170676107": {"recommendationid": "170676107", "author": {"steamid": "76561199094626285", "num_games_owned": 74, "num_reviews": 26, "playtime_forever": 4735, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 218, "playtime_at_review": 3638, "last_played": 1723243136}, "language": "english", "review": "cant go bowling with roman but the rest of the game is great", "timestamp_created": 1721878665, "timestamp_updated": 1721878665, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552429676055908203", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170627355": {"recommendationid": "170627355", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013541173", "num_games_owned": 1258, "num_reviews": 264, "playtime_forever": 23538, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 17058, "playtime_at_review": 998, "last_played": 1723544135}, "language": "english", "review": "GTA 5 is absolutely amazing and one of the best games I've played.

I have never seen such a good console port and a game that is technically close to perfection. The graphics are amazing.\r\n\r\nThe plot in a fascinating and satirical form shows how badly the American special services work. Switching between the main characters offers a pleasant change of pace. There are also many side quests in the game, some of them have their own plot, and some are common, but they are all fascinating.\r\nGTA Online offers no less content than a single player game.

I bought it for around 10$ and can see the appeal and I have played what it was worth on sale but it feels devoid of deep content. I admit that from time to time I did return to it but it feels shallow. No doubt there is a surface charm but there is nothing beyond the superficial here-no probing into why these systems occur, no wondering about how to improve things, no vision beyond cynical annihilation.\n\nFar more important and perhaps illuminating for newer gamers is my terrible customer service experience with RockStar Games. It was abysmal. Now, I knew of the rumors of long working hours that it foisted on its workers (allegedly for Red Dead Redemption 2) but I cringed and bought this and another game from them and the subsequent experience seemed entirely consistent with the ethos suggestive of the rumors.\n\nWhat is absolutely outrageous on the customer service side of things is that when I tried to update my email contact info for another RockStar game I purchased and played on Steam years ago, Red Dead Redemption 2, not only did they NOT contact me recently when I felt like revisitng the game but they actually removed the RDR2 game from my Steam account. Later, when I looked up the service ticket it said \"Resolved\",lol. That is what you are dealing with here. No customer service. No respect for supporters of their games. Indeed, what I experienced from RockStar is nothing short of utter contempt. Buyer beware. If you ever lose access to your account email, the resolution process is nonsensical. They have a byzantine resolution process in order to get gamers to and this is speculation here purchase multiple instances of the same game using different email accounts, which in my view is unethical since you already purchased the game once. If users need to or merely want to switch email accounts that should be of no concern to RockStar since they already purchased the game! The way they are operating shows no respect for customers. What this means is that you will never own the game, RockStar does. Just think about it. You pay for a game. You forget your email password to the account you used to and in my case years ago to originally login to their equally nonsensical account system (why are emails NOT needed in virtually every other game you buy? Control over you, that's why!) and then when you merely ask how to shift the game to a new email that is accessible, they delete the game from your Steam account. It is shady beyond belief and for all its worth I will never hesitate in warning off others from a developer that engages in such business practices.", "timestamp_created": 1723153116,

"last_played": 1721716612}, "language": "english", "review": "Singleplayer is amazing. The story, characters, map. Even after playing over and over again it's still entertaining. I like it way more than the GTA 4's story.\n\nAs for online - this is the reason why I don't recommend the game, because I think that most people nowadays buy the game mainly because of the online. Don't get me wrong; I used to love it, played over 400 hours of pure online, everything was awesome, I thought that this is the perfect multiplayer game, they are constantly updating it and there is a lot of stuff - which has become the problem. A year and a half ago, everything was more or less balanced, the prices were reasonable. After the Import/Export things were getting drastically different. Looked like this to me:\n\n\"Hey buddy, want to enjoy the content? Well, you should get our brand new garage only for 2M.\"\n\nThen Gunrunning. Again, my overall feelings:\n\n\"Look at this cool update! The players will be able to get their bunkers only for 1.5M. Also, don't forget to upgrade your equipment for another 1M. Did we forget to mention that getting additional people working for you will only cost you half a million? By the way, you will time from time get raided and lose everything, unless you buy another cameras for 400K! All the raids will magically disappear! Want to modify your weapons in your Workshop? Well, too bad, you need a trailer for that, but don't worry, it's only 1 to 2 and a half millions. Do you want to train your shooting? There you go, only for 700K! Do you prefer white over black? The paint costs 105K, so... Did we mention that you can take a nap there? The key for that room costs 265K. Do you want a Gun Locker which you will probably never use? That will be 175K. You want some caddies? 85K or 120K if you want to have them larger. Don't forget to check out the new cars! Get yourself a car that shoots a couple of missiles only for 4-5M!\"\n\nHow I felt about Smuggler's Run:\n\nHello there! This update will be about planes. Want a hangar? 1 to 5M. Which style would you prefer? The one for 100k or the one for 320k? Want different lights? No problem - the more expensive style you chose the more expensive lights you'll get! Isn't that cool? Want some nice 'art' on the floor? Sure, we'll paint it for you, costs only up to 200k, just like your apartment you bought last year to do heists! Furniture? You mean another wall? That's another 280k for you. Again, want the keys to access your bed? 235k-375k. You want to customize your 500k glider? One word - WORKSHOP! And guess what this number, 1,150,000 means... Correct! It's the price!\"\n\nThe prices of the content added were skyrocketing, if you wanted to truly enjoy the game, you had to either make money all day long if you wanted to be a fair dude that doesn't hack, which is by the way, another big problem with this game, or buy some cards that are horribly overpriced. At this point I didn't have time to play all day long, I didn't want to hack and I totally didn't want to spend twice the price of the game on some cards, so I stopped playing. Since then, I've been ignoring the game, not watching any videos and not paying attention to the updates. Sometimes, when I notice that there's an update, I come back for a couple of minutes and look how a vehicle with a couple of missiles costs over 4 millions. Now another heist update, you might think this:\n\n\"Oh, finally another heist, things are getting back to the state when you could buy a house for 200k and get full content.\"\n\nThe reality, however, looks like this:\n\n\"Hey, it's nice to see you back in the game, look at this brand new heist room only for 2 millions, the same idea, only way more expensive.\"\n\nAnd as a person who doesn't have that much time to play anymore, I can't enjoy the content anymore. Another problem with this game are the hackers.

gamer who appreciates a well-crafted open-world experience, I approached Grand Theft Auto 5 with high hopes. However, my initial enthusiasm quickly turned into profound disappointment as I delved deeper into the game. Here\u2019s why:\n\n**The Good (If Only It Mattered):**\nGrand Theft Auto 5 is undeniably a technical marvel. The sprawling city of Los Santos is rendered with breathtaking detail, from its bustling streets to the serene beauty of its countryside. The game offers a vast array of activities, from high-octane heists to leisurely rounds of golf, catering to a wide range of player interests. The storyline, featuring three distinct protagonists, initially promises depth and complexity, weaving their narratives together in a seamless dance of crime and consequence.\n\n**The Bad (Because It Truly Is):**\nDespite its technical achievements and breadth of content, Grand Theft Auto 5 ultimately falls short due to a glaring oversight that completely ruins the immersion: the complete absence of ducks. Yes, you read that right\u2014ducks. In a game where realism is supposedly paramount, the developers inexplicably failed to include ducks in any form. Whether it's the urban ponds of Los Santos or the tranquil lakes dotting the countryside, not a single quack can be heard, nor a feather seen drifting idly on the water.\n\nThis oversight is not just an aesthetic blunder but a gameplay flaw, as it undermines the ecosystem's integrity within the game world. Players are left wondering why the developers spent countless hours meticulously crafting every other aspect of Los Santos while neglecting such a basic and fundamental element of urban wildlife.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, Grand Theft Auto 5 is a prime example of a game that could have been exceptional if not for its inexplicable omission of ducks. While the city of Los Santos may glitter with the promise of adventure and crime, its lack of waterfowl serves as a constant reminder of missed opportunities and unfulfilled potential. Until this oversight is rectified, Grand Theft Auto 5 remains a disappointing reminder of what could have been, leaving players longing for a world where ducks roam freely and quack with reckless abandon.", "timestamp_created": 1721808334, "timestamp_updated": 1722324104, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170600685": {"recommendationid": "170600685", "author": {"steamid": "76561199060240467", "num_games_owned": 7, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 838, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 125, "playtime_at_review": 353, "last_played": 1723284500}, "language": "english", "review": "i killed a sex worker \nand then i went to play gta 5 \n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1721792088, "timestamp_updated": 1721792088, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170181799": {"recommendationid": "170181799", "author": {"steamid": "76561199062038657", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 21258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4911, "playtime_at_review": 13459, "last_played": 1723519255}, "language": "english", "review": "hi", "timestamp_created": 1721325693, "timestamp_updated": 1721325693, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170097585": {"recommendationid": "170097585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101990325", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 10281, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 10281, "last_played": 1718775458}, "language": "english", "review": "My mom didn't let me play this game, or even watch others play it.

It gets criticized for all different reasons and I would also criticize a lot about it, but it's still one of my favourite games of all time. It lacks some things the other GTAs have to offer, but makes up for that in other parts where it really excels. Another important part for GTA V is modding.

Heist to think there is only one player and cancel it in the middle so you all have to start over again from the beggining , then in that process not be able to join because it says the invite is invalid and kicks you from the session into single player GTA and have to go back to online which will take another 10 mins of your time. etc etc with the connection issues and bugs in teh game, it is the worst i have ever seen, but, in Rockstars defense, they do not charge a server fee which understandably gives them zero incentive to fix any of these problems with the online game play issues i see. \n\nas far as gameplay goes, i would rate this game to be no better or worse fun than any other game out there, really nothing special its middle of the road, and having put 355 hours into it i feel i am giving it a fair chance, even if roughly 100 of those hours were spend getting into a session and getting randomly disconnected and having to reconnect constantly, \n\nmaybe they will work on the ability for the game to function as an online version before they release GTA 6, i hope for all thier customers sakes", "timestamp_created": 1723338023, "timestamp_updated": 1723338892,

You bet.\n\nThe sheer variety of activities is mind-blowing. Whether you're cruising through the city in a tricked-out ride, battling rivals in intense PvP matches, or just chilling with your crew in a luxury penthouse, GTA Online ensures there's always something exciting to do.\n\nAnd let's talk customization. From your character's appearance to your garage full of vehicles and even your own personal nightclub, the level of detail is astonishing. Every choice you make shapes your experience, whether you're climbing the criminal ranks or simply enjoying the nightlife.\n\nRockstar Games continuously updates GTA Online with new content, keeping the experience fresh and players coming back for more. From new missions and challenges to themed events and seasonal updates, there's always something new to discover.\n\nBut what truly sets GTA Online apart is its community. Whether you're making alliances or testing your skills against other players, the social aspect adds a whole new dimension to the game.

I have purchased many of the largest Sharkcards so that I could unlock everything and have fun with it. Until today, I have had no issues and enjoyed the online play. \n\nToday I ran into my first issue. A vehicle I purchased was not delivered. When reaching out to support, they were unwilling to do anything to correct this and refused any solution at all despite providing them with what was asked for. This was a horrible first experience and will be my last. Today is the last day I play GTA Online. Rockstar needs to try fixing things when they mess something up and not just refuse to assist all together. Horrible experience with their support has now changed the game for me unfortunately. This was a complete surprise and I thought better of Rockstar than this, until now.\n\nEdit: Rockstar has given in-game currency for the \"inconvenience\" and \"confusion\" while saying that it is not for compensation. \n\nThe confusion is on their end.
