There is nothing else quite like Don't Starve. I could sit here for an hour just writing about all the things this game does really well, and all the things that make the experience unique. So you might find yourself asking why this review is negative. What could possibly be so bad that it essentially voids all this good will? \n\nThis games net-code is so horrendously garbage, perhaps the worst I've ever encountered in a game like this, that playing with friends is an objectively worse experience than playing singleplayer. To make matters worse, the only reason this distinction can be made between multiplayer and singleplayer, is because an extremely talented member of the community made a mod that actually fixes the input delay and desync issues you'd experience when playing ON A LOCAL SERVER BY YOURSELF. To elaborate just a little for the sake of clarity, this game runs a server for the overworld, and a separate server for the underground/caves. This leads to horrible performance issues and network delay no matter what computer you have. These issues are understood to be a fixture of the game by the community and have been since its release. There is nothing you can do about this. Your build does not matter, your internet does not matter, these issues are permanent and universal and the devs have done NOTHING to fix them. Installing the mod \"Don't Starve: Alone\" (which is a hilarious appeal to how absurd this issue is especially given the nature of the game and its working title.) will fix these issues when playing by yourself, which is a completely valid and enjoyable way to interact with the game if that's what you are looking for. But Don't Starve is a stressful and unforgiving game that relies so heavily on time management (the kind of experience that is immensely more fun with a friend) that this issue is almost unforgivable for me. Playing with the mod and then switching to multiplayer means not only having to get use to massive amounts of input delay, it also means you're taking unavoidable damage, it means every singe action you take and make for your entire play-through feels horrid, and this is a game where the player is meant to die and die and die before you even learn that there are specific actions and routes you're meant to take to progress effectively in new runs. (things that require hundreds of hours of game knowledge to pull off and take advantage of). \n\nI could write another 3 paragraphs about why this is such a problem and why it bothers me so much, but if I took the time to do that, it would be more time than they've spent in development trying to fix the netcode issues since the games release. Horrible horrible stupid issue for a game like this to have. I love this game and understand its highly positive reviews, but I'm frankly also perplexed this isn't brought up more. It makes it so hard to get friends into the game and makes a learning curve that is shaped like Mt Kilimanjaro somehow even less accessible to new players. If you are willing to play alone exclusively, and are willing to put hundreds and hundreds of hours to see 60% of the content, then yes, buy this game. But most players will spend their first 50 hours repeatedly dying to new things and repeating the first 5% of content over and over, not even beginning to understand some of the needlessly arbitrary ways you interact with the game's world, unless you watch hours and hours of guides giving you explicit information and explaining things you most likely never would have pieced together yourself. \n\nI love this game, but find myself mentally exhausted at the thought of even trying to pick it up most the time.

Potential of Don\u2019t Starve Together[/h2]\n\n[i]Don't Starve Together[/i] was launched with high expectations. The core mechanics of the original game lent themselves beautifully to a multiplayer setting. Players could work together to gather resources, build bases, fend off seasonal challenges, and face the game's unique blend of horrors. However, while the game received periodic updates, it never saw the expansive development that fans hoped for.\n\n[h2]Unrealized Development Opportunities[/h2]\n\nKlei had an opportunity to create a game that could rival other popular multiplayer survival games. The foundation was there: a devoted fanbase, a well-established game world, and mechanics that could easily be expanded upon. These expansions could have kept the game fresh and engaging for years. Advanced modding support, regular content updates, and deeper storylines could have transformed [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] into a cornerstone of the multiplayer survival genre.\n\n[h2]Why Focusing on One Game Makes Sense[/h2]\n\nInvesting heavily in one successful game, rather than spreading resources across multiple projects, can lead to a more engaged and loyal community. Players are more likely to rally behind a game that receives consistent updates, new content, and developer support. This approach has several benefits:\n\n[b]Stronger Community[/b]: A single, well-supported game can foster a strong and active community. Players feel a sense of ownership and investment in a game that continues to evolve and improve.\n[b]Brand Loyalty[/b]: Consistently supporting and expanding one game can build brand loyalty. Players who see ongoing value in their purchase are more likely to support the developer in future endeavors.\n[b]Economies of Scale[/b]: Investing in one game allows for economies of scale in development, marketing, and support. Resources can be used more efficiently, leading to better overall returns.\n\n[h2]Examples of Developers Who Made Similar Mistakes[/h2]\n\nSeveral developers have made the mistake of abandoning successful games in favor of new projects, often with disappointing results:\n\n[b]Stunlock Studios[/b]: Known for [i]Bloodline Champions[/i], Stunlock Studios let the game stagnate, then shifted focus to new games. They developed [i]Battlerite[/i], a spiritual successor to [i]Bloodline Champions[/i], but again failed to maintain long-term support, leaving fans disillusioned.\n[b]Digital Extremes[/b]: While [i]Warframe[/i] eventually became a huge success, Digital Extremes initially struggled with inconsistent support for their other titles like [i]Dark Sector[/i] and [i]The Darkness II[/i]. Only after committing to [i]Warframe[/i] did they find sustained success.\n\n[h2]The Tarnished Multiplayer Experience[/h2]\n\nOne significant issue plaguing [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] is the poor multiplayer experience. The game's multiplayer mode was meant to enhance the survival experience through cooperative play, but instead, it has introduced several problems that detract from the game's original charm. Players often find themselves in lobbies where experienced veterans clear the hardest content in mere seconds. Meanwhile, new or less experienced players are still harvesting their second tree, leading to a disjointed and unbalanced gameplay experience.\n\nThis disparity ruins the once challenging aspect of the game and makes a true cooperative experience impossible. Instead of working together to overcome obstacles, players are often not even on the same screen most of the time. This lack of coordination and shared purpose fundamentally undermines the cooperative nature of [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] and turns what should be a team effort into a fragmented and frustrating experience.\n\n[h2]Financial Implications and Cost Analysis[/h2]\n\nFrom a financial perspective, the decision to underdevelop [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] appears misguided. The game has a loyal player base willing to purchase expansions, cosmetic items, and other forms of downloadable content. A well-supported and continually updated [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] could have ensured a steady revenue stream. Instead, Klei has missed out on this potential by not capitalizing on the game's initial success.\n\nLet's break down the costs and missed opportunities:\n\n[b]Development Costs[/b]: Developing [i]Don't Starve[/i] likely cost around $1.5 million, considering it was an indie project with a small team. Adding the multiplayer component for [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] might have added another $1 million.\n[b]Server Costs[/b]: Maintaining multiplayer servers typically costs around $500,000 annually. Over the past ten years, this amounts to $5 million.\n[b]Investments in Other Projects[/b]: [i]Griftlands[/i] likely cost around $5 million to develop, while [i]Oxygen Not Included[/i] might have cost around $10 million. [i]Hot Lava[/i] and other projects could add another $5 million to the total.\n[b]Total Potential Investment in DST[/b]: If Klei had redirected even a portion of these funds into [i]Don't Starve Together[/i], let's say $10 million, it could have led to substantial content updates and server improvements.\n\n[h2]Comparing Player Numbers[/h2]\n\nComparing the player numbers between Klei's games and other popular cooperative games highlights the missed opportunity:\n\n[i]Don't Starve Together[/i]: Peaked at 20,000 concurrent players in 2016, now averaging around 5,000 to 6,000.\n[i]Oxygen Not Included[/i]: Peaked at around 18,000 concurrent players.\n[i]Griftlands[/i]: Peaked at around 5,000 concurrent players.\n[i]Hot Lava[/i]: Peaked at around 3,000 concurrent players.\n\nComparing to other big cooperative multiplayer games:\n\n[i]Terraria[/i]: Peaked at 486,918 concurrent players in 2020.\n[i]Minecraft[/i]: Millions of concurrent players across various platforms.\n[i]ARK: Survival Evolved[/i]: Peaked at 157,400 concurrent players in 2020.\n\n[h2]The Merger and Future Prospects[/h2]\n\nIn early 2021, Klei announced that Tencent, the Chinese tech giant, had acquired a majority stake in the company. This merger has raised questions and concerns within the community. Some fans hoped that the infusion of resources from Tencent would lead to renewed investment in [i]Don't Starve Together[/i]. However, others feared that this corporate shift would further divert Klei's attention away from their beloved franchises.\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\n\n[i]Don't Starve Together[/i] represents a significant missed opportunity for Klei Entertainment. The game had all the ingredients to become a staple of the multiplayer survival genre. Instead, it has languished without the support it deserves, to the frustration and disappointment of its loyal fans. By neglecting [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] in favor of other projects, Klei has not only lost potential revenue but also eroded the goodwill of their community.\n\nThe investments in other games have not yielded the expected returns, and the funds that could have been allocated to [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] are now depleted. The game's development is now essentially in \"life support\" mode, with little hope for significant updates or improvements. Trust and willingness from investors to reinvest in [i]Don't Starve Together[/i] are at an all-time low, making it unlikely that the game will see the revitalization it desperately needs. Thus, prospective buyers should be aware that the game's future looks bleak, and their money might be better spent on more actively supported cooperative alternatives.", "timestamp_created": 1722275921, "timestamp_updated": 1722281127, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170445125": {"recommendationid": "170445125", "author": {"steamid": "76561199511236807", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 319, "last_played": 1721773709}, "language": "english", "review": "Very cool, like VERY cool. very Don't.\nVery Starve\nand Extremely together :3", "timestamp_created": 1721613514, "timestamp_updated": 1721613514, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170436449": {"recommendationid": "170436449", "author": {"steamid": "76561198850473464", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 764, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 654, "last_played": 1721609055}, "language": "english", "review": "I have no idea how to live.

But then I die the same way when I respawn. This game also had a crossover with the game that is better than Minecraft: Terraria. When I see the eye bone when i'm out exploring, I feel as I'm being brought closer to heaven. When I play Walter and I get hit I loose my precious sanity and get pulled closer to hell. When I play as Webber and get killed by my spider companions I feel as if my parents are more disappointed in me. When I play as Wilson and he gets another stage of beard growth, I feel as I'm laying in a tranquil, calm forest. As I close my eyes and start to drift off to sleep I sleep too long and I get killed by darkness. When I play as Willow and I loose a little bit of sanity I make a tiny, insignificant fire. When I get my sanity back I take a look at the forest fire and realize I've disappointed my idol, Smokey the Bear. When I unravel all my clothes for more spools I realize that I'm poor, but at least I got a new plant friend to keep me company. When I play as Woodie and it becomes a full moon I stare at glommer taunting me in my goose form. When I play as WX-78 and I eat spoiled food I feel as I am helping the environment by eating the food no one else will. Overall, this game is awesome, but when playing you will need a professional player with you, a Youtube tutorial, or the wiki open. The Beard is the best one to follow along with.

So i decided to make a Steam account and get this game to see if I could maybe play alongside him. I loaded into the game, picked my character and world and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to do. I asked my Son for help and he hosted a game for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spent with my Son since my wife had died. This game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well. This game reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Son many happy memories.", "timestamp_created": 1719433652, "timestamp_updated": 1719433652,

you to impromptu cannibalism..[/h3]\nThe games title is basically a great pitch for the entire game, you run around in a slightly spooky twilight zone with your quirky friends trying to find enough calories to pass around before the monsters find you and drain your life and sanity in equal measure. \n\nDST revolves around the same great loop of exploration, resource management and crafting that was the hallmark of Don\u2019t Starve, only now you can do it with a bunch of equally deranged pals, and it is so much better with friends.. The intricate dynamic that emerges from a spontaneous division of labor (sprung straight from Marx's manifesto), combined with the creepy victorian atmosphere and gorgeous hand drawn art works wonders balancing out the ever diminishing levels of hunger, sanity and health. The entourage of characters, all with their own powers and weaknesses, enables you to gather a dream team of quirky individuals and start building an utopia in the otherwise dreary wilderness.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3276704701\nNow, if a buyer should know one thing about this game is that the learning curve is quite steep, and since time passes in game with seasons that quickly can turn a chill vacation into a nutrient starved death trap one must be aware of a few key mechanics to even survive the first year into the game. The reward for mastering this game however is, in my humble opinion, oh so sweet.\n\nIn the end this is a game I keep returning to, and not only for the daily login gift that is an economy in itself, but for the emerging narrative that is so vibrant. There are so many hilarious ways to fail in this game and each and every one of them leads to a great story. So try to remember that when you get harassed to death by murderous frogs and tentacles trying to get enough paper to write your final will..\n\nRecommended, but be aware that it can be quite daunting to get into, especially if you have never encountered the first installment of the game..", "timestamp_created": 1719516835, "timestamp_updated": 1719558117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 23, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.686233460903167725", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "166377076": {"recommendationid": "166377076", "author": {"steamid": "76561198451606428", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4725, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 4725, "last_played": 1717132291}, "language": "english", "review": "A dark fantasy survival filled with magic and science!
