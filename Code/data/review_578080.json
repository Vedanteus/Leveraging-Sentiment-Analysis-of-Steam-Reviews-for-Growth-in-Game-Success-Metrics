The developers are either complicit in cheating or are incompetent as to how to prevent it - and are too preoccupied making the worst cash shop known to man to milk money out of the whales still playing.", "timestamp_created": 1721422207, "timestamp_updated": 1721422207, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.562624275684356689", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170379327": {"recommendationid": "170379327", "author": {"steamid": "76561198407474347", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 106, "last_played": 1721269356}, "language": "english", "review": "Please reward this comment.

I swear, someday I'll get a chicken dinner solely with that pan.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nAddiction Warning: Seriously, PUBG should come with a warning label: \"May cause neglect of real-life responsibilities and a sudden interest in camouflage fashion.\"\r\n\r\nGlitchy Shenanigans: Sure, the glitches are part of the charm, but not when you're stuck halfway through a wall or your car decides to moonwalk across the map.\r\n\r\nFriendship Tester: PUBG has taught me who my real friends are \u2014 they're the ones who revive me instead of looting my corpse.\r\n\r\nFinal Verdict:\r\n\r\nPUBG is like that bad influence friend who convinces you to do dumb things but also gives you unforgettable memories. It's a rollercoaster of emotions, from triumphant chicken dinners to face-palming defeats. I can't quit. So, if you see someone crouched in a corner with a frying pan, it's probably me \u2014 and I regret nothing.", "timestamp_created": 1721789274, "timestamp_updated": 1721789274, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "170592061": {"recommendationid": "170592061", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059982057", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 10646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 798, "playtime_at_review": 9514, "last_played": 1723518368}, "language": "english", "review": "Who's idea is it to do server maintenance at prime time??

Loot for 20 minutes, then die to someone with level 2500 or a cheater. Macros are everywhere; people shoot without recoil. Matchmaking is a joke. You\u2019re paired with Silvers against level 2500 squads. BattleEye is a useless anti-cheat. They removed items, slashed prices, and made the game free after you spent money.\r\n\r\nEvents are interesting. Sure, I got both an Aston Martin and a Lamborghini in different passes. But missions are way too repetitive. Interesting game modes appear very rarely, and the matchmaking is a nightmare of terrible genius. As a Diamond 2, playing Ranked (which we paid for) with my Diamond 2 friend, we get matched with and against Silvers who don\u2019t even have level 100.

1718562624}, "language": "english", "review": "I don't know any other game that fell harder from its high point to the face of the earth. Holy man, I can't describe the amount of disappointment.\n\nLet's start where it all began: PUBG was released in December 2017, and I started playing it then. PUBG became THE BATTLE ROYALE. I had great fun with the game; it was never boring for a good 2 years. All the friends we made during this time\u2014I\u2019ll never forget them.\n\nThe downfall began at the end of June 2018 with the release of Sanhok. I really despise this map; it ruined everything that made PUBG great. The game went from a slow to rapid pace, with 100 players in such a small area. It would have been better to just add a TDM mode, WHICH THEY ADDED WAY TOO LATE. They added a map no one wanted to play, and they removed the map selection. So you always had the chance to either play a nice round of Erangel or Miramar. I loved both, and although it took some time to adjust to Miramar, I loved it regardless. But the chance of getting Sanhok\u2014everyone was so pissed and annoyed that we would drop and try to die as fast as possible or, honestly, we mostly quit the round right there and hoped to get the \"good maps.\"\n\nAt that point, we couldn\u2019t care less about the completely useless battle passes they added. Anyways, we tried to enjoy the game for what it was: \"a simple battle royale\" where you didn\u2019t need to grind levels or BP coins or whatever. Some months later, I just stopped playing. I would always come back to check out the new maps, and some of them were really good. Vikendi, finally a snow map\u2014I loved it. But at that point, I felt something wasn\u2019t right. Every single player was insanely good all of a sudden. Did I really lose all my skill in the small amount of time I didn\u2019t play? But then it clicked. The real sweating tryhards, who are all wannabe pro players, never stopped playing, and the casual players we played with most of the time were gone. The only ones left were either the streamers or the tryhards.\n\nAnd this feeling got so much worse every week. So, of course, I wanted to get better. Which, at that point, was still achievable. But in the current day, it\u2019s almost impossible since the current player level is way too high for new players or even returning players. I don\u2019t have the time, after working and getting all my daily life things done, to play for 8 hours just to improve. And with the decline of the player base, you see way more cheaters in your games, which makes it even more miserable since you can't improve against someone who just one-taps you from 500 meters, even when in full sprint.\n\nAnyways, let's look into the abysmal shop they have created. Since I\u2019ve already spent over $3k on this game, I really discourage anyone from buying anything. If you want a weapon skin, check the marketplace on Steam. Most of the cool stuff is behind EA loot boxes, which will burn your whole wallet.\n\nBut wait, there's more. Want the really cool and unique weapon skins? Good luck. Those are way too expensive for the normal player base, and of course, they are time-limited. They really want to push you to get those since you don\u2019t know when or if they\u2019ll come back ever again.\n\nCheaters don\u2019t get banned anymore. Most of the players I reported got a 24-hour ban even though they clearly killed our entire squad with no clear vision.\n\nPlease, I beg everyone to stop supporting this game.\n\nTL;DR: It was the best battle royale for a good year. Today, this game is infested with cheaters and filled with loot boxes that bleed you dry.

After weeks of unsuccessful attempts between the demonstrators and the Chinese government to find a peaceful resolution, the Chinese government declared martial law on the night of 3 June and deployed troops to occupy the square in what is referred to as the Tiananmen Square massacre. The events are sometimes called the '89 Democracy Movement,[b] the Tiananmen Square Incident,[c] or the Tiananmen uprising.The protests were precipitated by the death of pro-reform Chinese Communist Party (CCP) general secretary Hu Yaobang in April 1989 amid the backdrop of rapid economic development and social change in post-Mao China, reflecting anxieties among the people and political elite about the country's future. The reforms of the 1980s had led to a nascent market economy that benefited some people but seriously disadvantaged others, and the one-party political system also faced a challenge to its legitimacy. Common grievances at the time included inflation, corruption, limited preparedness of graduates for the new economy,[5] and restrictions on political participation. Although they were highly disorganized and their goals varied, the students called for things like rollback of the removal of \"iron rice bowl\" jobs, greater accountability, constitutional due process, democracy, freedom of the press, and freedom of speech. Workers' protests were generally focused on inflation and the erosion of welfare. These groups united around anti-corruption demands, adjusting economic policies, and protecting social security.At the height of the protests, about one million people assembled in the square.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1718227675, "timestamp_updated": 1718227675, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 420, "votes_funny": 77, "weighted_vote_score": "0.85932689905166626", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "168489766": {"recommendationid": "168489766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247548560", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 3704, "last_played": 1720989150}, "language": "english", "review": "Only trust reviews written after 2020.

Sure, it's not the most graphically advanced game out there, but it gets the job done and runs smoothly on most setups.[/i]\n\n[h1]Gameplay and Mechanics:[/h1]\n[i]The core of PUBG is simple: you drop into a map with up to 99 other players, scavenge for weapons and gear, and fight to be the last one standing. The shrinking play zone keeps you on your toes, forcing you to strategize and adapt on the fly. What sets PUBG apart is its realistic shooting mechanics and the variety of weapons and attachments you can find. Every match feels different, and the thrill of outsmarting opponents is unbeatable.[/i]\n\n[h1]Sound and Immersion:[/h1]\n[i]The sound design is top-notch. You'll find yourself holding your breath when you hear footsteps nearby, trying to pinpoint the direction of gunfire, or the sound of a distant vehicle approaching. The audio cues are crucial for survival and add a lot to the tension and excitement of each game.[/i]\n\n[h1]Community and Multiplayer:[/h1]\n[i]Playing solo is fun, but teaming up with friends in duo or squad mode brings another level of excitement. Communication and teamwork are key to winning, and coordinating with your squad can lead to some epic moments. The community is vast, and while you'll encounter some toxic players, there are also plenty of opportunities to meet new friends and allies.[/i]\n\n[h1]Comparing to Other Battle-Royales:[/h1]\n[i]Compared to other battle-royale games like Fortnite or Apex Legends, PUBG leans more towards realism. There's no building structures or super abilities, just pure, tactical survival. This might appeal more to players who enjoy a more grounded and strategic gameplay experience.[/i]\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Realistic and intense gameplay\n[*]Detailed maps with unique environments\n[*]Strong sound design that enhances immersion\n[*]Variety of weapons and attachments\n[*]Great fun with friends in duo or squad modes\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]Graphics aren't the most advanced\n[*]Can be a bit buggy at times\n[*]The learning curve might be steep for new players\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Final Thoughts:[/h1]\n[i]\"PUBG Battlegrounds\" offers a raw and thrilling battle-royale experience that stands out for its realism and strategy.

What once was a gritty, intense survival battle royale has now devolved into an absurd carnival of pink bunny costumes and a rainbow atmosphere.\n\nPUBG started with a clear vision: a realistic, high-stakes battle where survival depended on strategy and skill. The adrenaline rush of being the last one standing in a harsh environment was what drew me in. But now, that essence is completely lost.\n\nThe game is now a freak show, cluttered with bizarre, inappropriate content that clashes with its original spirit. Seeing players in garish pink bunny outfits feels like a slap in the face to those of us who cherished PUBG's realistic, survivalist roots. This whimsical, cartoonish aesthetic is not what I signed up for.\n\nMoreover, the frequent collaborations with childish girl bands only make it worse. Instead of teaming up with brands that align with PUBG's intense atmosphere, the developers seem intent on chasing trends that have no place in a game that once prided itself on mature, brutal gameplay.\n\nIt's disheartening to see a game with so much potential lose its way so dramatically. The developers' focus on adding superficial content instead of enhancing the core gameplay experience is a huge misstep. PUBG no longer feels like the game I fell in love with; it feels like a cheap, desperate attempt to appeal to a broader audience.\n\nUntil the developers remember what made PUBG great\u2014its authenticity, intensity, and true survival battle royale experience\u2014it's hard to see a future for this game that doesn't involve more frustration and disappointment.", "timestamp_created": 1718358919, "timestamp_updated": 1718359481, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.552136719226837158", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "167496153": {"recommendationid": "167496153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071472256", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 27, "playtime_forever": 473, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 373, "last_played": 1718640768}, "language": "english", "review": "the best collaboration NewJean's collaboration", "timestamp_created": 1718546889, "timestamp_updated": 1718546889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550488591194152832", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169555115": {"recommendationid": "169555115", "author": {"steamid": "76561198285332189", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 80, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 21, "last_played": 1709652190}, "language": "english", "review": "Fortnite won the battle", "timestamp_created": 1720663245, "timestamp_updated": 1720663245, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550224900245666504", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "169471875": {"recommendationid": "169471875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198250068986", "num_games_owned": 0, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 8206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 8206, "last_played": 1526507007}, "language": "english", "review": "kpop", "timestamp_created": 1720583099, "timestamp_updated": 1720583099, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550156712532043457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "hidden_in_steam_china": true, "steam_china_location": ""}, "165580191": {"recommendationid": "165580191", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059121117", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 1488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "playtime_at_review": 1488, "last_played": 1512437782}, "language": "english", "review": "Does not and did not hold up, though the game was a cultural movement when it released and can't be discredited for inspiring a million imitators.
